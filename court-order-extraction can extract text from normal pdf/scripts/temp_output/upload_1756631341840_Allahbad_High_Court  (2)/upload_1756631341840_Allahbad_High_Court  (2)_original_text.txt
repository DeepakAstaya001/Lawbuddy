in Mohal Mustahakam, Village, Alenganj, Pargana, Bhud, District, Kheri, before
abolition of Zamindari i.e. in khatauni 1356 Fasli was recorded in the Khewat

result, their names were entered/ recorded in khatauni 1359 Fasli prepared by the
Lekhpal in Red Ink in Ziman 5-A as U.P. Land Records Manual was applicable to
Non-Z.A. Area of Oudh with a duration of one year.
2. The names of the predecessor in interest of the petitioners were recorded in
khatauni 1359 Fasli over plot nos.21/2 to 21/7 (annexure no.4). The said entry
continued. The village was brought under consolidation operations, after issue of
notification under section 4 of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act (hereinafter called)
the Act and the names of the predecessor in interest of the petitioners were recorded.
Notification under section 52 of the Act was published in 1392 Fasli and the records
were remitted to Tehsil Authorities, Tehsil, Gola, District, Kheri. Fresh khatauni was
prepared in 1395 Fasli and the names of the predecessor in interest of the petitioners,
namely, Dal Singh & others were recorded over new nos. 22Kha to 22Chha.
3. The petitioners purchased the land in dispute, admeasuring 31.35 acres from the
recorded tenure holders under registered sale deeds dated 17.3.1997, 28.4.1997,
2.5.1997, 1.7.1997 and 4.7.1997 for valuable sale consideration.
4. In pursuance to the sale deeds, possession was delivered to the petitioners and
their names were also mutated in revenue records. Prior to the purchase by the
petitioners, they made enquiries and they were informed by the Forest Settlement
Officer, Kheri that the plots in dispute were not acquired by the Forest Department
for reserve forest. It is submitted that a notification under section 4 of Indian Forest
Act in respect to an area of 246.67 acres was issued relating to plot no * 0.22 = 21/2
old number and other plots. Thereafter a notification under section 20 of the Act was
issued in respect to aforesaid plots on 26.4.1968 (annexure no.8).
5. As stated above, after purchase of the property in dispute from the recorded
bhumidhars, the names of the petitioners were mutated and they are bonafide
purchasers for valuable consideration without notice.
6. After a lapse of 45 years, an application was made by the Divisional Forest Officer
(opposite party no.4) for deleting the names of the predecessor in interest of the
petitioners from the aforesaid plots, stating therein that the property in dispute is
reserve forest. Sub Divisional Officer, Gola Gokran Nath, called upon a report from
the Tehsildar, Gola, who submitted a report on 16.5.1995 (annexure no.10), stating
therein that the recorded tenure holders as per the report of the Lekhpal and
Supervisor Kanoongo are in continuous possession and are paying its land revenue. A
notification under section 20 of the Act was issued. On a comparison of the
settlement map, it is apparent that plot nos.22 and 27 are outside reserve forest,
standing on plot nos.21 and 23 and reserve forest situate at a distance of one km away
from the plots in dispute. The Sub Divisional Officer, on a consideration of entire
facts and the evidence on record, including the report submitted by the Tehsildar,
rejected the application made by the Forest Department vide order dated 30.6.1995.

7. After rejection of the application made by the opposite party no.4, no action was
taken by the Forest Department, assailing the said order by filing an appeal or
revision and the petitioners, as stated above, are in continuous cultivtory possession.
8. It is submitted that as mentioned above, the petitioners being in occupation in
1358 Fasli and were cultivating the land in dispute and being recorded as occupants
in 1359 Fasli, by virtue of section 20 (b) of the Act read with Rule 177 - A , they
became Sirdar and lateron Bhumidhar by virtue of amendment made under section
131 of U.P.Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act, as has been laid down by this
Hon'ble Court as well as Apex Court in the case of Smt. Sonawati, 1968 R.D. pages
151 and 2008 (8) SCC, page 58, Ram Avadh & others versus Ramdas & others.
9. The petitioners submit that longstanding entries could not be corrected in
proceedings under section 33/39 of U.P.Land Revenue Act, as neither the State
Government nor the Forest Department had ever assailed the longstanding entries
recorded in the name of the predecessor in interest of the petitioners and after
purchase. in the name of the petitioners, hence the application for correction of the
entries made by the opposite party no.4 was rightly rejected by the Sub Divisional
Officer, Gola.
10. The petitioners further submit that no notification, either under section 4, 6 or
under section 20 of Indian Forest Act had so far been issued in respect to the plots in
dispute. As mentioned above, since the land was lying vacant, the predecessor in
interest of the petitioners starting cultivating the land in dispute without the consent
of the landlord and being in occupation, their names were recorded by the concerned
Lekhpal in Ziman 5-A of U.P. Land Records Manual applicable to Oudh.
11. Again an application was made by the Divisional Forest Officer, South, Kheri for
correction of the entries in revenue records in respect to the plots in dispute, on
which a report was again called upon from the Tehsildar, Gola Gokran Nath.
12. Sub Divisional Officer, Gola, even without affording any opportunity of hearing to
the petitioners, passed an order on 28.10.1999 (annexure no. 13) for deleting the
names of the petitioners and recording the land in dispute in the name of Forest
Department "Imarati Lakari Ke Jangal, Zere-Intezam, Forest Department."
13. Being aggrieved by the exparte order dated 28.10.1999, the petitioners filed a revision no.54
(L.R.) 1999-2000 before the Board of Revenue, which was allowed vide order dated 11.10.2000
(annexure no.14) and the matter was remanded to the Sub Divisional Officer, Gola to pass fresh
orders on merits, after impleading Gaon Sabha as well as after affording opportunity to the
petitioners to adduce their evidence, after examining the original records. While remanding the
matter, the Board of Revenue had specifically observed in para 4 of the judgment to the effect that
the Forest Department could not produce any evidence in support of its claim that the land belongs
to the Forest Department. It was further observed in para 6 of the order that the order dated

28.10.1999 passed by the Sub Divisional Officer is illegal and is liable to be set aside. The revision
deserves to be allowed in part. A direction was issued that after registering a case under section
33/39, by arraying Gaon Sabha as a party, the matter may be decided afresh and in case, the entries
made in revenue records are found to be forged, proceedings may be initiated against erring
officials.
14. The petitioners being aggrieved by the order dated 11.10.2000 (annexure no.14) filed writ
petition (M.S.) No.174 of 2001 which was allowed vide judgment dated 12.9.2014. It was observed
that the petitioners claimed title under section 20 (b) of U.P.Act No.1 of 1951 as their predecessor in
interest were recorded occupant in khatauni 1359 Fasli and in view of the law laid down by the Apex
Court, entry in 1359 Fasli must be genuine and made according to the provisions of the Land
Records Manual and not a fake entry. The said issue has not been decided by any court or authority.
No proceedings for correction of land records were taken under U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act
and prior entries continued. It was further observed that in the absence of any notification under
section 117 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act, Gaon Sabha has nothing to do in the
matter. The matter was thus remanded to the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Kheri to conduct a
proper enquiry, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the parties, if necessary, he may frame an
issue and remit the matter to the Consolidation Officer for recording oral and documental evidence
of the parties and may pass appropriate orders after receiving evidence and findings of the
consolidation officer, after hearing the parties.
15. After remand, the Deputy Director of Consolidation even without complying the terms of the
order of remand, as in view of the law laid down by the apex court in the case of Jasraj versus
Hemraj, AIR 1977 SC page 1011. remanded the entire matter to the Consolidation Offier, where the
statement of Forest Ranger was recorded. He had specifically stated that he does not know the
number of the plots mentioned in the notification under section 20 of the Forest Act. He also does
not know the number of the plots in dispute and their corresponding numbers prior to consolidation
operations.
16. It would be pertinent to point out here that prior to passing of the order by the Sub Divisional
Officer, on the subsequent application made by the Forest Department (opposite party no.4) for
correction, an exparte report was submitted behind the back of the petitioners as they were not
afforded any opportunity to participate in the said enquiry and this Hon'ble Court, while allowing
the writ petition filed by the petitioners, after setting aside the orders passed by the Sub Divisional
Officer and the Board of Revenue, remanded the matter to the Deputy Director of Consolidation,
Kheri to conduct a proper enquiry, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the parties. No such
enquiry, after remand of the matter by this Hon'ble Court, was ever made and the Sub Divisional
Officer, resting upon the exparte report of the Commissioner (annexure no.12), he passed an order
for deleting the names of the petitioners from the plots in dispute and recording the same in the
name of Forest Department, as reserve forest, although this Hon'ble Court has also observed, while
allowing the writ petition that Forest Department had failed to substantiate its claim by leading any
evidence which is also evident from the notification dated 1.7.1968 issued under section 20 of the
Forest Act, mentioning the notification issued on 29.3.1954 under section 4 of the Forest Act,
wherein the plots in dispute does not find mention, hence the plots in dispute could not be said/held

to be reserve forest, more particularly in view of the State Amendment made under section 4 of the
Indian Forest Act published on 1.2.1966.
17. Being aggrieved by the order dated 16.10.2019 (annexure no.2) passed by the Consolidation
Officer, to whom, the matter was remanded by the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Kheri to decide
the matter on merits, though in pursuance to the order of remand passed by this Hon'ble Court, vide
judgment dated 12.9.2014 (annexure no.15), a direction that was issued to the Deputy Director of
Consolidation, Kheri to conduct a proper enquiry, after giving opportunity of hearing to the parties,
decide the same. Thus the order passed by the Consolidation Officer (annexure no.2) was not only
illegal but also against the terms of the order of remand, in view of the law propounded by the Apex
Court aforesaid.
18. Being aggrieved, the petitioners filed an appeal before the Settlement Officer of Consolidation,
Kheri, who remitted the appeal to the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Kheri, after quoting the
observations made by this Hon'ble Court vide judgment dated 12.9.2-14 (annexure no. 19).
19. The petitioners thereupon filed a revision under section 48 (1) of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings
Act, befoe the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Kheri, who also endorsed the order passed by the
Consolidtion Officer, resting upon exparte report submitted by the Commissioner, which was
inadmissible as he had not come in the witness box to prove the said report. Deputy Director of
Consolidation, Kheri (opposite party no.2), except quoting the judgments passed by the apex court
had not decided the lis as per the observations made by this Hon'ble Court, vide judgment dated
12.9.2014 (annexure no.15). Thus the order passed by the opposite party no.2 was not only illegal
but also without jurisdiction as well as against the terms of the order of remand. Now it is well
settled proposition of law as has been propounded by the Apex Court that if the matter has been
remanded by the higher court to the lower court with certain directions, the lower court is bound by
the terms of the order of remand and has to decide the matter accordingly and cannot traverse
beyond the specific terms of the order of remand. Thus the order passed by the opposite party no.2
is not only illegal but also without jurisdiction.
20. Main controversy involved, as has been observed by this Hon'ble Court vide 12.4.2014 (annexure
no.15), has not yet been decided and the opposite party no.2, though he was required to decide
himself, but instead of doing so, he had remitted the matter to the Consolidation Officer, after
deciding the matter in accordance with law merely relying upon the exparte report of the
Commissioner which was inadmissible. allowed the application made by the Forest Department and
the said order has been endorsed by the opposite party no.2.
21. The petitioners submit that there is an enactment known as United Provinces Forest Act, 1948
(U.P.Act No.4 of 1949) (hereinafter called) the Private Forest Act of which section 2 provides that
the said Act will not apply to any land which is vested in the Government or to any land in respect of
which notifications and orders have been issued under the Indian Forest Act. Section 3 (15) defines
the Private Forest. Section 13 deals with the management of the forests by owners under an
approved working plan. Section 25 deals with the extinction of rights other than the landlords'
rights. Section 42 deals with the right of rightholders to be exercised in accordance with the rules,

while section 46 relates to the release of vested forests. As mentioned above, the plots in dispute had
never been acquired for reserve forest, which could not be, in view of the submissions made
hereinabove i.e. the State Amendment, made in section 3 of the Indian Forest Act and further after
insertion of Chapter 5-A by U.P.Amendment, the claimant has been defined in section 38-A (a)
means the claimants, claiming to be entitled to the land or any interest therein, acquired, owned,
settled or possessed or purported to have been acquired, owned, settled or possessed whether under
through or by any lease or license executed before the commencement of Act no.1, 1956 or owned in
accordance with the provisions of any enactment, including the said Act. The petitioners, who have
acquired rights by remaining in cutltivatory possession in 1359 Fasli, by virtue of section 20 (b) of
the Act became Sirdar and after abolition of zamindari and later on after amendment of Act no.131,
they became bhumidhar with transferable rights. The State, Forest Department as well as Gaon
Sabha had failed to establish the said entry to be forged or fictitious and the sole reliance placed by
the Deputy Director of Consolidation as well as Consolidation Officer that there was a
cutting/interpolation in the khatauni, the State through its counter affidavit has specifically stated
that subsequently an insertion was made below the area of plot no.21 i.e. 393.910 acres as 431.46
acres which is evident from the khatauni filed by the petitioners as annexure no.4 is incorrect as the
State of U.P. filed a counter affidavit in writ petition 174 of 2001 (M.S.) filed by the petitioners in
which they had annexed the Photostat copy of the certified copy of khatauni obtained on 16.1.1999
as (annexure no.CA-1), there was no such cutting or interpolation. Photostat copy of the said
khatauni is annexed herewith. Thus the findings recorded by the opposite parties no.2 and 3,
dismissing the revision and allowing the application made by the Forest Department (opposite party
no.4) are not only illegal but also against the law.
22. The petitioners submit that the provisions of United Provinces Forest Act, 1948 came up for
consideration before this Hon'ble Court in the case of Mohd. Karrar Ali & others versus State of U.P.
& others) reported in 1954 Allahabad, page 753, wherein it was propounded that U.P. Private Forest
Act has got no application to the land other than forests.
23. The petitioners submit that so far as section 20-A inserted by the State Amendment Act in the
Forest Act is concerned, the same has got no application and the land in dispute could not be
said/held and deemed to be reserve forest as the land in dispute does not belong to the category
mentioned in that section and the findings recorded by the opposite party no.2 that the land in
dispute is deemed forest is vitiated in law. The land which is recorded in the revenue records as
forest land belonging to the government in respect to that the said provision will apply and not in
respect to the land in dispute of which the petitioners became Bhumidhar by operation of law being
recorded occupant in khatauni 1350 Fasli in accordance with the provisions of Land Records
Manual, para 123 in Red Ink, with the result, they became bhumidhar.
24. In view of the submissions made hereinabove, the writ petition may be allowed. The orders
passed by the opposite parties no.2 and 3 be set aside."
7. From the side of State opposing the present petition and supporting the impugned order(s), in
nutshell, Sri Pandey, learned counsel for the State submitted as under:-

(i) Intentionally Khatauni of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) of Gata/Plot No. 21 has not been
placed on record. In the 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.), the land in dispute was recorded as
"Imarati Lakdi Ka Jungle" (Timber Trees), as indicated in entry (8) (iii)(a)(1) of Para
124-A of U.P. Land Records Manual and in this year the total area was 431.61 acres
and in the Khatauni of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) the land in dispute was not recorded in
the name of Raja Brijraj Bahadur Singh. To establish the same, a copy of Khatauni of
1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) was placed before this Court and the same was made part of
record.
(ii) In the 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) without any order or recording any reasons, the area
of Gata/Plot No. 21 was reduced from 436.46 to 431.61 acres as in the Khatauni of
1346 Fasli (1939 A.D.) the area was 436.46 acres. Subsequently in the 1359 Fasli
(1952 A.D.), the area of Gata/Plot No. 21 was again reduced as in the Khatauni of
1 3 5 9  F a s l i  ( 1 9 5 2  A . D . ) ,  3 7 . 5 5  a c r e s  w e r e  r e c o r d e d  i n  t h e  n a m e  o f
predecessor-in-interest of petitioners that too without any order of competent
person/authority under Ziman 5-A entry, which finds place in Para A-124 of U.P.
Land Records Manual, and the same says that "Occupiers of lands without title when
there is no one already recorded in column 5 of the khasra".
(iii) The Ziman 5-A entry favourable to the petitioners was not based upon any order
of comptent revenue Official and in fact, is not in accordance with the procedure
prescribed under the U.P. Land Records Manual including Para(s) 80, 81-A, A-80,
A-81, 89-A and 89-B and accordingly this entry of 1359 Fasli (1352 A.D.), favourable
to the petitioners, is completely fictitious, baseless, bogus, surreptitious and forged
and can't be relied upon to extend the benefits to the petitioners.
(iv) The specific findings have been made in the impugned order(s) on the entry
favourable to the petitioners and accordingly petitioners ought to have placed the
relevant material on record to impeach the said findings related to the entries in the
revenue record particularly the entries made in the Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952
A.D.), in which names of predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners were entered after
creating/carving new Gata(s)/Plot(s) No. 21/1 to 21/7 from Gata/Plot No. 21 that too
without any order in this regard. However, no such document has been placed on
record to impeach the said findings.
(v) The basis of initiation of proceedings against the petitioners was the report dated
07.06.1999 (Annexure No. 12 to the writ petition). According to this report, the
entries, as indicated by the petitioners, of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) and 1359 Fasli (1952
A.D.) are forged/bogus entries and to controvert and impeach the same, no
document has been placed on record except a questionnaire, annexed as Annexure
No. 3 to the petition, which is also a bogus document and is not liable to be relied
upon.

(vi) If the facts mentioned in Para 4 of the petition are taken to be true, though not
correct, that Gata/Plot No. 21 area 431.61 acres situated in Mohal Mustahkam
Village-Allenganj Pargana-Bhud, Tehsil-Gola, District-Lakhimpur-Kheri, before
abolition of zamindari i.e. in Khatauni of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) was recorded in the
khewat Khatauni of Raja Brijraj Bahadur of Jhandi Estate in Ziman 8(3)(1) of
Non-ZA Khatauni, then also the petitioners would not get any right over the said land
or part of the said land because the correct entry i.e. 8(iii)(a)(1) and the note
appended to the same itself indicate that the same was under the control of Forest
Department meaning thereby under the control of State Government and further, for
the reason that at the time of submission of report dated 07.06.1999 trees were about
80-100 year old and accordingly, present age of the trees would be about 105-125
year and the trees of Sal (Shakhu) were/are covered under the expression "Timber
Tree" as indicated in the said entry i.e. 8(iii)(a)(1) readwith note appended to the
same.
(vii) The alleged entry of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) in favour of Raja Brijraj Bahadur
Singh, as indicated in questionnaire, is forged one and the fact that questionnaire
itself is forged/fabricated and bogus document can be deduced from the fact that in
the year 1999 the age of trees was found to be between 80-100 year and accordingly
in the 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) or 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) the age of the trees must be
between 40-60 year and to impeach/controvert the same and also the findings
related to existence of trees over the land in issue, which in fact was admitted by
Mahesh Chandra Saxena and Nanhey Lal Sharma (Petitioner No. 4) during their
examination and the same is evident from the impugned order dated 10.04.2023,
nothing has been placed on record and accordingly, the entries of the 1356 Fasli
(1949 A.D.) and 1359 Fasli(1952 A.D.) including regarding crop of Barley/Jow etc., as
pleaded, are bogus and no right could be provided to any person including the
petitioners, who have purchased the land from the persons whose names were
recorded in the Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) without any order in this regard.
(viii) The land indicated in terms of entry 8(iii)(a)(1) in the revenue record is a 'Public
Utility Land' and this entry is similar to the entry indicated in Para A-124 applicable
in the area over which Act of 1950 applies and after considering the entry i.e.
5(iii)(a)(1) provided under Para A-124, this Court has already settled the issue in
various pronouncements according to which, no right would be available to any
person over such type of lands.
(ix) So far as the contention of learned counsel for the petitioners is concerned that
the petitioners are saved under Section 20(b) of the Act of 1950. The same has no
force as petitioners' case is basically based on entry in the revenue record of the
Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) and the Section itself indicates 1356 Fasli (1949
A.D.).

(x) The benefit of Section 20(b) of the Act of 1950 would be available if the entry
was/is genuine and in this case, the entry of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) itself was/is bogus
and fraudulent and as such, no right would be available to the petitioners based upon
the sale deed as their basis itself is not a valid document in the eye of law. In this view
of the matter, maxim 'Sublato Fundamento Cadit Opus', which means 'foundation
being removed, the structure falls', would apply in the present case.
(xi) A person, who was not having any title, cannot create a title. In view of the fact
that the predecessor-in-interest of petitioners were having no right over the land in
dispute in terms of entry 8(iii)(a)(1) in the revenue record as also that without any
order, the corrections were made in the Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.), no right
would flow to the petitioners despite sale deed(s) in their favour. Reference can be
made to the maxim 'Nemo dat quod non habet' which means 'no one can give what
they do not have'.
(xii) In this case, if the orders are interfered with on account of jurisdiction of
respondent No.2 and/or on the ground that respondent No.2 has failed to act in
terms of order of remand of this Court dated 12.09.2014 or on other procedural
irregularities, then in that event, the bogus/forged entries, favourable to the
petitioners, would revive in the revenue records, which were not in consonance with
the law on issue. Thus, no interference is required in the matter.
(xiii) The entry in the revenue record was undisputedly in the 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.)
and prior to same was 8(iii)(a)(1) i.e. "under the management of Forest Department
(including erstwhile forest made over to Forest Department)" and a conjoint reading
of the same as also Section 117 of the Act, 1950 and Section 132 of Act of 1950 would
indicate that no right can be provided to an occupier of the forest land or land
managed by the Forest Department.
(xiv) The rights were provided to the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners on the
basis of entry in Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) ignoring the fact that the original
Gata/Plot No.21 indicated in the 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) was renumbered as 21/1 to
21/7 without any order of the revenue authority and to dispute or controvert this fact,
no order has been placed on record and accordingly, it shall be presumed that the
petitioners are admitting the fact that without any order of competent authority, the
entries/corrections were made while preparing Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.).
(xv) In the matter, an inquiry was also carried out by the Commissioner, Lucknow
Division, Lucknow and after concluding the inquiry, he submitted his report dated
07.06.1999 to the Principal Secretary, Forest Department. The inquiry report is part
of the record as Annexure No.12 to the present petition appended at page No.136 and
a perusal of the same indicates that in the 1346 Fasli (1939 A.D.) and 1356 Fasli (1949
A.D.), the land was recorded under Category 8(iii)(a)(1), which in fact was forest
land. It also indicates that the new numbers were allotted to original Gata No.21

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76142227/

without any order of the competent authority and this report would override the
report of Tehsildar filed in the year 1995, which was basically based on the entries
made in 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) and the Gata(s) involved in the notification issued
under Sections 4 & 6 of the Act of 1927. The report dated 17.06.1999 also indicates
that over the land in issue, there are several trees about 82-100 year old.
(xvi) Before the concerned authority i.e. Consolidation Officer, the statements of the
witnesses were recorded and as per the statement(s) of Mahesh Chandra Saxena
(Petitioner No.1) and Nanhey Lal Sharma (Petitioner No.4) the adjacent land to the
land in issue belongs to the Forest Department and over the land in issue, there are
as many as 2752 trees. Thus, the submissions of the learned counsel for the
petitioners, based on the averments made in the present petition, that land is vacant
land and was/is being used for agricultural purpose is completely fallacious and
baseless rather false.
(xvii) Section 20A of the Forest Act, as applicable in Uttar Pradesh, provides deeming
clause and according to the same, the land in issue is to be recognized and held as
land of Forest Department and not of the petitioners.
(xviii) The land of the Forest Department is the land covered under the expression
"the land used for public purpose" and accordingly, Section 132 of the Act of 1950
would be attracted and no right can be provided to any person over the land
described under Section 132 of the Act of 1950 nor the claim over the same is legally
valid.
8. In addition to above, the written submission dated 24.05.2024 was also filed on behalf of the
State, which is extracted hereinunder:-
"1. That the Khatauni of village Alanganj, Pargana Bhud, District Kheri, recorded in
Account No. 91 of 1356F, plot no. 21, area 431.46 acre, is recorded as timber trees of
forest. Notes of Para 124-A Category 8 defines "timber trees" and says it means a tree
the value of which mainly lies in its timber for building purposes and in its fruit or
like produce. Examples of timber trees are sakhu, sagaun, hasna, deodar, haldua,
country mango (not qalmi), neem, sheesham, jamun, asna, mahua, etc. Such trees as
bargad, pakar, peepal, gular etc. are not timber trees." Further it admitted fact that
the entire portion of Bhukhand numbers - 21 and 22 is a vast forest of Sal trees
(Saakhu Trees) with the age of the trees estimated to be between 80 to 100 years. It is
noteworthy that the trees grow naturally every year.
2. That the area of 431.46 acres of Gata No. 21- recorded in the Khata no. 98 of
Khatauni 1359F of Village Alianganj Pargana Bhud District- Kheri was illegally
reduced to 393.91 acres without any order.

3. That there was consolidation in the above mentioned village (Elanganj), after
consolidation as per CH-41, Gata No. 22A area was 158.44 acres of timber forest, 22B
area was 2.20 acres of forest, 22C area was 6.60 acres of forest, Gata No. 22D area
was 7.15 acres of forest, Gata No. 22E was 8.30 acres of forest, Gata No. 22F was 5.00
acres of forest, Gata No. 22G was recorded as 2.10 acres of forest.
4. That Dr. George Joseph, Principal Secretary, Forest Department, Uttar Pradesh
Government, through his letter no. 290/15/Camp/98 dated 30.11.98, requested the
District Magistrate Lakhimpur-Kheri, to set up inquiry regarding irregularities
committed in revenue records of forest land situated at village Ailanganj Pargana
Bhood, Lakhimpur-Kheri. Considering the seriousness of the matter, the
Government, with the approval of the Honorable Chief Minister, decided to get the
matter investigated/inquired by Commissioner, Lucknow Division, Lucknow.
5. The Commissioner, Lucknow Division, Lucknow, conducted a site inspection on
04.06.99 in the presence of advocate representative of Shri Mahesh Chandra Saxena
and others, village headmen, and former tenure holders/sellers. Following an
examination of all village revenue records and land maps, etc., a report on the
investigation/inquiry was submitted to the government on 07.06.99. Upon
examination, the Commissioner, Lucknow Division, Lucknow, has reached the
conclusion that based on the scrutiny of revenue entries, it is evident that prior to the
Consolidation, the old plot number 21 (Bhukhand Sankhya-21) had an area of 436.46
acres in the settlement year of 1346 Fasli and it was recorded as Jimman 8(3)(a)(1) of
Land Record Manual. It is noteworthy that prior to the abolition of Zamindari, the
land under Jimman 8(3)(a)(1) (As per Awadh para 124-A) of Land Records Manual
was designated as "forests of timber trees under the management of the forests
department (including erstwhile private forests made over to forest department).
Notes of Para 124-A Category 8 defines "timber trees" and says it means a tree the
value of which mainly lies in its timber for building purposes and in its fruit or like
produce. Examples of timber trees are sakhu, sagaun, hasna, deodar, haldua, country
mango (not qalmi), neem, sheesham, jamun, asna, mahua, etc. Such trees as bargad,
pakar, peepal, gular etc. are not timber trees." Further it admitted fact that the entire
portion of Bhukhand numbers - 21 and 22 is a vast forest of Sal trees (Saakhu Trees)
with the age of the trees estimated to be between 80 to 100 years. It is noteworthy
that the trees grow naturally every year.
6. That the examination of the aforementioned entries makes it clear that prior to the
Consolidation, the land was area 436.46 acres of plot number 21 (Bhukhand
Sankhya-21) in settlement of 1346 Fasli and with an area of 436.46 acres was also
recorded in Khatauni year of 1346 Fasli, under Jimman 8(3)(a)(1) of the settlement
year. It is noteworthy that prior to the abolition of Zamindari, the land under
Jimman 8(3)(a)(1) (As per Awadh para 124-A) of Land Records Manual was
designated as "forests of timber trees under the management of the forests
department (including erstwhile private forests made over to forest department). In

the Khatauni of Fasli year of 1354 Fasli, the area of the aforementioned land plot
number 21 (Bhukhand Sankhya-21) was recorded area 431.46 acres, Jimman
8(3)(a)(1) (As per Awadh para 124-A) of Land Records Manual was designated as
"forests of timber trees under the management of the forests department (including
erstwhile private forests made over to forest department) and the same entry was
also found and continued in the Khatauni fasli year 1356 Fasli. Notes of Para 124-A
Category 8 defines "timber trees" and says it means a tree the value of which mainly
lies in its timber for building purposes and in its fruit or like produce. Examples of
timber trees are sakhu, sagaun, hasna, deodar, haldua, country mango (not qalmi),
neem, sheesham, jamun, asna, mahua, etc. Such trees as bargad, pakar, peepal, gular
etc. are not timber trees." Further it admitted fact that the entire portion of
Bhukhand numbers - 21 and 22 is a vast forest of Sal trees (Saakhu Trees) with the
age of the trees estimated to be between 80 to 100 years. It is noteworthy that the
trees grow naturally every year.
7. That Prior to the abolition of Zamindari, a person who had occupied land without
any title was entitle to enter his name in Jimman 5Ka. Upon examination of the
Khatauni of 1359 Fasli year, it is apparently evident that in Khata Number - 89
lagayat Khata Number - 94, certain entries at the end of Jimman 5, were initially
omitted and cutting was made and later included certain entries in another
handwriting, and the area of Bhukhand Number- 21 of Khata number 98 under
Jimman 8(3)(a)(1) "forests of timber trees" (As per Awadh para 124-A) of Land
Records Manual was reduced from 431.46 acres to 393.91 acres. In the Khasra of
1359 Fasli, the Bhukhand Number- 21 was initially recorded as 431.46 acres under
Jimman 8(3)(a)(1) ""forests of timber trees under the management of the forests
department (including erstwhile private forests made over to forest department)."
(As per Awadh para 124-A), and made a new Plot number- 21/1, and the area was
reduced from 431.46 acres to 393.91 acres by cutting down the area. Entries of 21/2
to 21/7, which could have been associated with the aforementioned Bhukhand
Number- 21, but it was entered at the end of the Khasra. It is evident that there was
no space between Bhukhand Number- 21 and 22, where the entries of 21/2 lagayat
21/7 could have been recorded. In the Khasra of 1359 Fasli, cultivation of "Barley" in
the Rabi season is shown in bhukhand numbers - 21/2 to 21/7. However, the total
area of barley cultivation in the prepared GOSWARA at the end of the Khasra is
245.72 acres, whereas in all the pages of the Khasra, the total area of barley
cultivation in different plots comes 194.75 acres. Clearly, the area recorded in the
GOSWARA is higher, which raises doubts about the entries in the Khasra. During the
inspection of the land in dispute, it was found that the entire portion of Bhukhand
numbers - 21 and 22 is a vast forest of Sal trees (Saakhu Trees) with the age of the
trees estimated to be between 80 to 100 years. It is noteworthy that the trees grow
naturally every year.
8. That Bhukhand numbers - 22Kha lagayat 22Cha€ has not been marked neither in
the Map of consolidation settlement nor in the revenue map of the concerned village.
Mahesh Chandra Saxena And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru. Collector, Kheri And ... on 16 July, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76142227/
15

Additionally, there is no separate sub-division of land Bhukhand number - 22 at the
site, and there is no possession by the recorded persons over any area Bhukhand
numbers - 22Kha lagayat 22Cha. Therefore, the disputed area 31.35 acres remains
part of Bhukhand number - 22, and the entire area of Bhukhand number - 22 is/has
been under the exclusive possession of the Forest Department. Thus, it is evident that
the entries made in name of sellers and their ancestors in the Khasra and Khatauni
were wholly illegal and without any basis. Forged or fraudulent, entries do not give
any right to anyone. Fraud and forgery rob a document of all its legal effect and
cannot found a claim to possessory title.
9. The Apex Court in case of Bachan and another Vs. Kankar and others, AIR 1972 SC
2157 has held that an entry incorrectly introduced by Patwari into the record of rights
in favor of a person is fictitious and confers no right on such person. The entries in
the Khatauni of 1359 Fasli are completely illegal because the names Jimman 5A could
have been entered in the Khatauni of 1359 Fasli, which name would have been
mentioned in column 4 of the Khasra. At the end of the Khatauni of 1359 Fasli,
entries were added by different handwriting, while omitting and cutting of certain
entries in another handwriting, and fraudulently created a new khatas 21/2 to 21/7.
The entry of crop cultivation of "Barley" in the Khasra of 1359 Fasli has been total
inconsistent with the spot because agriculture activities are not feasible due to the
presence of approximately 80 to 100-years old sal trees on these plots. Bhukhand
numbers - 21 and 22 is a vast forest of Sal trees (Saakhu Trees).
10. In view of aforesaid, the entries in revenue record of 1356 Fasli and 1359 Fasli, as
pleaded, are fictitious entries. A fictitious entry is one which is not genuine. It is an
unreal entry. A fabricated entry is a fictitious entry, as held by this Hon'ble Court in
Ramjeet Upadhyaya and Ors. vs. Dy. Director of Consolidation, Allahabad and Ors.
MANU/UP/2846/2011. The entries made by the revenue officials in the settlement
and revenue records of 1359 Fasli do not have any legal basis based on the principle
of distant boundary settlement. In Vikram Singh Junior High School v. District
Magistrate (F and R) and ors. 2002 (2) AWC 1262 (SC, it was held that an entry in
the revenue record must have a legal basis.
11. "Fraud" as is well known vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice never dwell
together. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which includes the other
person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the
conduct of the former either by words or letter. It is also well-settled that
misrepresentation itself amounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may
also give reason to claim relief against fraud. A fraudulent misrepresentation is called
deceit and consists in leading a man into damage by willfully or recklessly causing
him to believe and act on falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes
representations, which he knows to be false, and injury enures therefrom although
the motive from which the representations proceeded may not have been bad. An act
of fraud on Court is always viewed seriously. A collusion or conspiracy with a view to
Mahesh Chandra Saxena And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru. Collector, Kheri And ... on 16 July, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76142227/
16

deprive the rights of the others in relation to a property would render the transaction
void ab initio. Fraud and deception are synonymous.
12. In A.V. Papayya Sastry v. Government of A.P, (2007) 4 SCC 221, the Supreme
Court was pleased to held that if any judgement or order is obtained by fraud it
cannot be said to be a judgement or order. The relevant portion of the aforesaid
judgement is quoted below:
"19. Now, it is well-settled principle of law that if any judgment or order is obtained
by fraud, it cannot be said to be a judgment or order in law. Before three centuries,
Chief Justice Edward Coke proclaimed;
Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or temporal.
*** *** ***
22. It is thus settled proposition of law that a judgment, decree or order obtained by
playing fraud on the Court, Tribunal or Authority is a nullity and non-est in the eye of
law. Such a judgment, decree or order by the first Court or by the final Court has to be
treated as nullity by every Court, superior or inferior. It can be challenged in any
Court, at any time, in appeal, revision, writ or even in collateral proceedings.
*** *** ***
38. The matter can be looked at from a different angle as well. Suppose, a case is
decided by a competent Court of Law after hearing the parties and an order is passed
in favour of the applicant/plaintiff which is upheld by all the Courts including the
final Court. Let us also think of a case where this Court does not dismiss Special
Leave Petition but after granting leave decides the appeal finally by recording
reasons. Such order can truly be said to be a judgment to which Article 141 of the
Constitution applies. Likewise, the doctrine of merger also gets attracted. All orders
passed by the Courts/authorities below, therefore, merge in the judgment of this
Court and after such judgment, it is not open to any party to the judgment to
approach any Court or authority to review, recall or reconsider the, order.
*** *** ***
39. The above principle, however, is subject to exception of fraud. Once it is
established that the order was obtained by a successful party by practising or playing
fraud, it is vitiated. Such order cannot be held legal, valid or in consonance with law.
It is non-existent and non-est and cannot be allowed to stand. This is the
fundamental principle of law 'and needs no further elaboration. Therefore, it has
been said that a judgment, decree or order obtained by fraud has to be treated as
nullity, whether by the Court of first instance or by the final Court. And it has to be

treated as non-est by every Court, superior or inferior."
13. That the Indian Forest Act 1927 is a complete code. The Indian Forest Act 1927 is a special Act
and these lands have been notified under section 20 of the Forest Act and are national property. In
the case of State of U.P. vs. Dy. Director of Consolidation and Ors. MANU/SC/0612/1996, the
Hon'ble Apex Court has held that -
"The crucial question for consideration, however, is whether the Consolidation
Authorities have the jurisdiction to go behind the notification under Section 20 of the
Act and deal with the land which has been declared and notified as a reserve forest
under the Act. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the scheme of Chapter II of the
Act. Section 3 provides that the State Government may constitute any forest land or
waste land which is the property of the Government or over which the Government
has proprietary rights, or to the whole or any part of the forest produce to which the
Government is entitled, a reserved forest. Section 4 provides for the issue of a
notification declaring the intention of the Government to constitute a reserved forest.
Section 5 bars accrual of forest rights in the area covered by the notification under
Section 4 after the issue of the notification. Section 6, inter alia, gives power to the
Forest Settlement Officer to issue a proclamation fixing a period of not less than three
months from the date of such proclamation and requiring every person claiming any
right mentioned in Section 4 or Section 5 within such period, either to present to the
Forest Settlement Officer a written notice specifying or to appear before him, and
state the nature of such right and the amount and particulars of the compensation (if
any) claimed in respect thereof. Section 7 gives power to the Forest Settlement
Officer to investigate the objections. Section 8 prescribes that the Forest Settlement
Officer shall have the same powers as a civil court has in the trial of a suit. Section 9,
inter alia, provides for the extinction of rights where no claim is made under Section
6. Section 11(1) lays down that in the case of a claim to a right in or over any land,
other than a right of way or right of pasture, or a right to forest produce or water
course, the Forest Settlement Officer shall pass an order admitting or rejecting the
same in whole or in part. In the event of admitting the right of any person to the land,
the Forest Settlement Officer, under Section 11(2), can either exclude such land from
the limits of the proposed forest or come to an agreement with the owner thereof for
the surrender of his rights or proceed to acquire such land in the manner provided by
the Land Acquisition Act, 1884. Section 17 provides for appeal from various orders
under the Act and Section 18(4) for revision before the State Government. When all
the proceedings provided under Section 3 to 19 are over the State Government has to
publish a notification under Section 20 specifying definitely the limits of the forest
which is to be reserved and declaring the same to be reserved from the date fixed by
the notification.
It is thus obvious that the Forest Settlement Officer has the power of a civil court and
his order is subject to appeal and finally revision before the State Government. The
Act is a complete code in itself and contains elaborate procedure for declaring and

notifying a reserve forest. Once a notification under Section 20 of the Act declaring a
land as reserve forest is published, then all the rights in the said land claimed by any
person come to an end and are no longer available. The notification is binding on the
Consolidation Authorities in the same way as a decree of the civil court. The
respondents could very well file objections and claims including objection regarding
the nature of the land before the Forest Settlement Officer. They did not file any
objection or claim before the authorities in the proceedings under the Act. After the
notification under Section 20 of the Act, the respondents could not have raised any
objections qua the said notification before the Consolidation Authorities. The
Consolidation Authorities were bound by the notification which had achieved
finality."
14. In a similar matter the Division of this Hon'ble Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. Kamal Jeet
Singh decided on 04.08.2017 MANU/UP/2821/2017, in which the Hon'ble Court has allowed the
claim of State of Uttar Pradesh held the following-
"From the above discussions, it is clear that the law laid down by Hon'ble the Apex
Court in the case of State of U.P. v. Deputy Director of Consolidation and others, 1996
All LJ 1393, is fully applicable in the case and the revenue authorities or the
authorities other than the authorities mentioned in the Forest Act cannot adjudicate
the claim over the land included in the notification under Section 4 or 20 of the
Forest Act.
On the basis of above legal propositions, we conclude the present petition as follows:
"I. From the date of notification under Section 4 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition Act
all the estate situates in U.P. vested in the State and stand transferred and vested in
the State free from all encumbrances.
II. The land in question was previously in 1356F or before that was recorded as
junglat/ghas/waste land.
III. Under the provisions of Section 3 of the Forest Act, the State may constitute any
forest land or waste land which is the property of the Government or over which the
Government has proprietary right and declare it as reserved forest. The land in
question was recorded as junglat being under the proprietary right of the State and
State has every authority to declare the land as forest land.
IV. After notification of Section 4 of the Forest Act no right shall be acquired in or
over the land comprised in such notification except by succession or under a grant or
contract in writing made or entered into by or on behalf of the Government. It is not
a case where grant was made by the Government.

V. No right shall be alienated by a grant, sale or otherwise without the sanction of the
State Government. Jagat Ram had no authority to transfer the land. Thus, the
respondents have no better title than Jagat Ram.
VI. As reported by the revenue authorities the land was recorded as bushes or woody
vegetation and it is included in forest in light of Section 38(a) & (b) of U.P. Act No.
XXIII of 1965.
VII. After the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Forest Act late Jagat
Ram through whom respondents claim their right on the basis of a transfer deed, had
filed an objection under Section 6 of the Forest Act and it was decided in the year
1958 and the land was declared as forest land. Thus the dispute reached to its finality,
as indicated above, and except revision before the State no authority has jurisdiction
to determine the rights as contained in Section 27-A of the Forest Act.
VIII. By way of measurement and by way of notification the petitioners have proved
that the land in, question is included in the notification under Section 4 of the Forest
Act."
46. Before parting with the order, we direct the Chief Secretary of U.P. to constitute a Committee
consisting Principal Conservator of Forest with Commissioner/District Magistrate/Divisional Forest
Officer/Sub Divisional Magistrate or any other Officer as may be deemed fit, having jurisdiction
over local area and to examine and verify the records relating to land vested in the State
Government/declared as forest reserved or forest land and to ensure that the land actually vested in
the State Government vide notification/order or by operation of any Law is entered in the relevant
records and name of the State Government is corrected and incorporated. Copy of the same be kept
with the Principal Conservator of Forest and concerned revenue records. The Registry is directed to
send a copy of this order to the Chief Secretary, Government of U.P. within fifteen days. On the basis
of submissions made above, the writ petition deserves to be allowed and the order dated 3.3.1978
passed by opposite party No. 3 and judgment and order dated 15.7.1978 passed by opposite party
No. 2 deserve to be quashed. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed and both the orders
mentioned above are hereby quashed. No order as to costs."
15. This Hon'ble Court in the case of State of U.P. and Ors. vs. Chunnu and Ors. (22.01.2022 -
ALLHC) : MANU/UP/0737/2022 while considering the Hon'ble Supreme Court ' judgment in AIR
2021 SC 4739) (Prabhagiya Van Adhikari Awadh Van Prabhag v. Arun Kumar Bhardwaj (Dead) Thr.
LRs. and others) has also allowed the claim of State Government.
16. In the case of CONSOLIDATION No. - 1268 of 1979 State Of Uttar Pradesh Through The
Divisional Forest Officer v. The Deputy Director Of Consolidation, U.P. And Others, the Hon'ble Has
held that Declaration under Section 20 of the Forest Act cannot be questioned either by the Civil
Court or by the Revenue Court or by consolidation Court. In spite of that D.D.C. held that land in
dispute was wrongly declared as reserved forest778 through notification under Section 20 of the Act.
D.D.C. clearly exceeded the jurisdiction. The declaration of reserved forest under Section 20 of the

Act is binding upon the Consolidation Court like Civil Court decree. In this regard reference may be
made to AIR 1996 S.C. 2432 State of U.P. V/S D.D.C.
17. This Hon'ble Court in case of Sharad Kumar Dwivedi vs. State of U.P. and Ors.
MANU/UP/3141/2022 considered the provisions of Para A-124 (5) (iii) Culturable Waste-
(a) Forests of timber trees-
(1) under the management of Forests Department (including erstwhile private forests
made over to Forests Department) (2) vested in the Gram Sabha.
(b) Forests of other trees, shrubs, bushes etc. (1) (1) under the management of Forests
Department (including erstwhile private forests made over to Forests Department)
(2) vested in the Gram Sabha." that is almost same as given under Jimman 8(3)(a)(1)
(As per Awadh para 124-A) of Land Records Manual was designated as "forests of
timber trees under the management of the forests department (including erstwhile
private forests made over to forest department). While examining the relavant laws
including the earlier authority of this Hon'ble Court in Gyanendra Singh Vs.
Additional Commissioner, Agra Division, Agra, MANU/UP/1697/2003 : 2003 (95)
RD 286 has held that the land recorded as 'Jangal Dhak' is a forest land and is a
public utility land and same cannot be transferred by way of lease, sale etc and no
bhumidhari rights shall accrue in respect of the said land. These lands are saved
under Section 132 of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950. This Court considering the
provisions of Section 132 of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950 held that lands recorded as
'Jangal Dhak' are covered by the lands enumerated under Section 132 U.P.Z.A. & L.R.
Act, 1950 and the same cannot be transferred in favour of anyone.
Radhey Shyam and Ors. vs. State of U.P. and Ors.
18. In the case of Gyanendra Singh Vs. Additional Commissioner, Agra Division, Agra,
MANU/UP/1697/2003: 2003 (95) RD 286. The Hon'ble Court held that the entry of the aforesaid
plot clearly indicates that the said plots are a kind of forest recorded as Dhaka Forest. The use and
utility of forest cannot be denied. Existence of forest are beneficial for human life and environment.
There cannot be any denial that forest land is a land of public utility. Section 132 of U.P. Zamindari
Abolition and Land Reforms Act mentions about the land in which bhumidhari rights shall not
accrue. Section 132 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act is extracted below :
132. Land in which (bhumidhari) rights shall not accrue.-Notwithstanding anything
contained in Section 131, but without prejudice to the provisions of Section 19,
(bhumidhari) rights shall not accrue in :
(a) pasture lands or lands covered by water and used for the purposes of growing
singhara or other produce or land in the bed of a river and used for casual or
occasional cultivation ;

(b) such tracts of shifting or unstable cultivation as the State Government may specify
by notification in the Gazette ; and
(c) lands declared by the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette, to
be intended or set apart for taungya plantation or grove lands of a (Gaon Sabha) or a
local authority or land acquired or held for a public purpose and in particular and
without prejudice to the generality of this clause :
(i) land set apart for military encamping grounds ;
(ii) lands included within railway or canal boundaries ;
(iii) lands situate within the limits of any cantonment ;
(iv) lands included in sullage farms or trenching grounds belonging as such to a local
authority ;
(v) lands acquired by a town improvement trust in accordance with a scheme
sanctioned under Section 42 of U.P. Town Improvement Act, 1919 (U.P. Act VII of
1919), or by a municipality for purpose mentioned in Clause (a) or Clause (c) of
Section 8 of the U.P. Municipalities Act, 1916 (U.P. Act VII of 1916) ; and
(vi) lands set apart for public purposes under the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act,
1953 (U.P. Act No. 5 of 1954).
The Sub-clause (3) of Section 132 includes land held for a public purpose on which bhumidhari
rights shall not accrue. The aforesaid three plots being recorded as "Dhaka Jangal" were covered by
land as enumerated in Section 132 and lease of bhumidhari rights with non-transferable right
cannot be granted on the said plots. No error has been committed by the courts below in cancelling
the lease granted in favour of the Petitioners. The submission of Petitioners is that other persons
have also been granted lease of "Dhaka Jangal", hence Petitioners have been discriminated in so far
as the lease of other persons have not been cancelled and the Petitioners have only been singled out
for cancellation. The counsel for the Petitioners has raised the submission based on discrimination.
As noted above, lease of "Dhaka Jangal" is not permissible in accordance with Section 132 of U.P.
Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act and the fact that leases were granted to certain other
persons cannot validate the lease of the Petitioners which was in violation of Section 132 of U.P.
Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. The plea of discrimination is not available in a case
where the benefit which was taken by other persons cannot be said to be in accordance with law.

another,MANU/SC/0136/1995 : (1995) 1 SCC 745, held that mere fact that the Respondent has
passed a particular order in the case of another person similarly situated can never be the ground for
issuing a writ in favour of the Petitioner on the plea of discrimination in case the order in favour of
other persons is found to be contrary to law or not warranted in the facts of this case. Following was
laid down in paragraph 8 :

8. We are of the opinion that the basis or the principle, if it can be called one, on
which the writ petition has been allowed by the High Court is unsustainable in law
and indefensible in principle. Since we have come across many such instances, we
think it necessary to deal with such pleas at a little length. Generally speaking, the
mere fact that the Respondent authority has passed a particular order in the case of
another person similarly situated can never be the ground for issuing a writ in favour
of the Petitioner on the plea of discrimination. The order in favour of the other
person might be legal and valid or it might not be. That has to be investigated first
before it can be directed to be followed in the case of the Petitioner. If the order in
favour of the other person is found to be contrary to law or not warranted in the facts
and circumstances of his case, it is obvious that such illegal or unwarranted order
cannot be made the basis of issuing a writ compelling the Respondent authority to
repeat the illegality or to pass another unwarranted order. The extraordinary and
discretionary power of the High Court cannot be exercised for such a purpose. Merely
because the Respondent authority has passed one illegal/unwarranted order, it does
not entitle the High Court to compel the authority to repeat that illegality over again
and again. The illegal/ unwarranted action must be correct, if it can be done
according to law indeed, wherever it is possible, the Court should direct the
appropriate authority to correct such wrong orders in accordance with law but even if
it cannot be corrected, it is difficult to see how it can be made a basis for its
repetition. By refusing to direct the Respondent authority to repeat the illegality ; the
Court is not condoning the earlier illegal act/order nor can such illegal order
constitute the basis for a legitimate complaint of discrimination. Giving effect to such
pleas would be prejudicial to the interests of law and will do incalculable mischief to
public interest. It will be a negation of law and the rule of law"
19. The Division Bench's Judgment of this Hon'ble Court in Radhey Shyam and Ors. vs. State of U.P.
and Ors, 2017(8)ADJ372, while considering the provision of section 20-A of the forest Act, allowed
the claim of similar nature in the favour of State Government. Section 20-A provides "20 A. Certain
forest land or waste land when deemed to be reserved forest--(1) Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being in force, including the Merged States
(Laws) Act, 1949 or the U.P. Merged States (Application of Laws) Act, 1950, or any order issued
thereunder, any forest land or waste land in a merged State which immediately before the date of
merger (hereinafter in this section referred to as the said date)-
(a) was deemed to be reserved forest under any enactment in force in that State, or
(b) was recognized or declared by the Ruler of such State as a reserved forest under
any law (including any enactment, rule, regulation, order, notification, custom or
usage having the force of law) for the time being in force, or
(c) was dealt with a reserved forest in any administrative report or in accordance with
any working plan or register maintained and acted upon under the authority of the
Ruler.

Shall be deemed to be and since the said date to have continued to be a reserved forest subject to the
same rights or concession, if any, in favour of any person as were in force immediately before the
said date.
Explanation I.--A certificate of the State Government or of any officer authorized in his behalf to the
effect that a report, working plan or register was maintained and acted upon under the authority of
the Ruler shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that it was so maintained and acted upon.
Explanation II---Any question as to the existence or extent of any right or concession referred to in
this subsection shall be determined by the State Government, whose decision, given after such
enquiry, if any, as it thinks fit, shall be final.
Explanation III.--"Working plan' includes any, plan scheme, project, map, drawings and lay-outs
prepared for the purpose of carrying out the operations in course of the working and management of
forests.
(2) No right shall be deemed to have been acquired on or after the said date in or over any land
mentioned in sub-section (1) except by succession or under a grant or contract in writing made or
entered into by or on behalf of the State Government or some person in whom such right was vested
immediately before the said date and no fresh clearings since made for cultivation or for any other
purpose (except clearings made in accordance with any concessions granted by the Ruler and in
force immediately before the said date or in accordance with the rules made by the State
Government in this behalf since the said date) shall be recognized as or deemed to be lawful,
anything contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in force notwithstanding.
(3) The State Government may within five years from the commencement of the Indian Forest
(Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1965, revise any arrangement of the nature specified in Section 22,
and pass any incidental or consequent, order, including any direction to the effect that any of the
proceedings specified in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter be taken.
(4) In relation to any land mentioned in sub-section (1), the references in Sections 24 and 26-
(a) to Section 23 shall be construed as references to sub-section (2); and
(b) to rights admitted, recorded or continued under Section 14 or Section 15 shall be construed as
references to rights of pasture or to forest produce admitted, recorded or continued in or under the
corresponding enactment, law or document referred to in sub-section (1).
(5) Without prejudice to any action that may be or may have been taken for ejectment, vacation of
encroachment or recovery of damages in respect of any unauthorized occupation of or trespass over
any land mentioned in sub-section (1), or for seizure, confiscation, disposal or release (on payment
of value or otherwise) of any forest produce in respect of which any forest offence has been
committed in relation to such land or of any tools, boats, carts, or cattle used in committing such
offence, nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize the conviction of any person for any act

done before the commencement of the Indian Forest (Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1965, which
was not an offence before such commencement."
20. The Hon'ble Court in the aforesaid case while considering section 20-A of the Forests Act
allowed the claim of State Government in the similar nature as in present petition and directed in
the operative portion as under-
"Before parting with the order, we are of the view to direct the Chief Secretary of U.P.
to constitute a Committee consisting Principle Conservator of forest with
Commissioner/District Magistrate/Divisional Forest Officer/Sub Divisional
Magistrate or any other Officer as may be deemed fit, having jurisdiction over local
area and to examine and verifying the records relating to land vested in the State
Government/declared as forest reserved or forest land and to ensure that the land
actually vested in the State Government vide notification/order or by operation of
any Law be entered in the relevant records and name of the State Government
accordingly be corrected and incorporated. Copy of the same be kept with the
Principle Conservator of Forest and concerned revenue records. With above
observations, we are of the view that both the writ petitions lacks merit and deserve
to be dismissed.
Accordingly, both the petitions are dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs."
21. That in this case in his evidence before the Subordinate Court, DW-2 Om Prakash Forest
Inspector of the Forest Department (Divisional Forest Officer) has clearly explained the situation in
his affidavit that the entire portion of Bhukhand numbers - 21 and 22 is a vast forest of Sal trees
(Saakhu Trees) with the age of the trees estimated to be between 80 to 100 years. It is noteworthy
that Sal trees grow on their own and the entire area is under the exclusive control of the forest
department. This Hon'ble Court in the case of Gyanendra Singh vs. Additional Commissioner, Agra
Division, Agra, 2003 (95) RD 286 has held that these are a forest and public utility land and the
same cannot be transferred by way of lease, sale etc. and no bhumdhari rights shall accrue in respect
of the said land. These lands are saved under Section 132 (c) as held for public purpose of the
U.P.ZA. & L.R. Act, 1950 and the said judgment has been further followed by this Court in its
judgment dated 05.07.2022 in Public Interest Litigation No. 7472 of 2021 and in the case of Sharad
Kumar Dwivedi vs. State of U.P. through Principal Secretary, Lucknow and others. Thus, it is a
reserved forest as per the provisions of section 20-A of the Indian Forest Act and same is covered
under section 132 (c) as held for public purpose of the U.P.ZA. & L.R. Act, 1950 of the Zamindari
Abolition & Land Reforms Act, 1950.
22. Since, in the Khatauni of 1356 Fasli, Gata Number 21 measuring area 431.46 Acres of Khata No.
91 of village Ailanganj Pargana Bhud District- Kheri, is recorded as a timber forest. Hence, in terms
of Section 20A of the Indian Forest Act, the entire area of Gata Number 21 measuring area 431.46
Acres of Khata No. 91 of village Ailanganj Pargana Bhud District- Kheri, is a reserved forest land.
More so, before the Subordinate Court, Mahesh Chandra Saxena himself has admitted in
cross-examination that the land in dispute is recorded as a forest in the revenue record of 1356 Fasli.

23. The legislature has inserted the aforementioned provisions with a laudable object. Forest is a
national wealth which is required to be preserved. The State is the owner of the forests and
forest-produce. Depletion of forests would lead to ecological imbalance. It is now well-settled that
the State is enjoined with a duty to preserve the forests so as to maintain ecological balance and,
thus, with a view to achieve the said object forests must be given due protection, keeping the
principles contained in Article 48-A and 51-A(g) of the Constitution of India in mind.
24. The Apex Court in Hinch lal Tiwari vs. Kamala Devi and Ors. reported in MANU/SC/0410/2001
: (2001) 6 SCC 496 and Jagpal Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and others reported in
MANU/SC/0078/2011 : (2011) 11 SCC 396 that the material resources of the Community like
forests, tanks, ponds, hillock, mountain etc; being nature's bounty need to be protected for a proper
and healthy environment as they maintain delicate ecological balance and enable people to enjoy a
quality life which is essence of the guaranteed right under Article 21 of the Constitution. The
Government including Revenue Authorities have been mandated to take appropriate steps under
the relevant statutory provisions to prevent damage, misappropriation of the such Public-Utility
land under Section 132 of the Act and, therefore, no bhumidhari right can be given on the forest
land. This is a national property for well-being of entire living creatures. In the above facts and
circumstances, the Writ Petition is liable to be dismissed with exemplary costs."
9. Having considered the aforesaid as also the pleadings and documents on record, this Court finds
it appropriate to first consider the issue related to category/entry under which the entire land in
issue i.e. Gata/Plot No. 21 was recorded in the Khatauni of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) and the relevant
para in this regard is Para-4 of the writ petition, which on reproduction reads as under:-
"4. That the disputed property was entered in the ownership of Raja Brijraj Bahadur
of Jhandi as proprietor/khewatdar/Zamindar of Mohal Mustahkam village Alenganj
Pargana Bhud District Kheri, before abolition of Zamindari in Uttar Pradesh. Before
1356 F Gata no.21 area 431.61 acr. was entered as owner with possession in the
khewat khatauni of Raja Brijraj Bahadur of Jhandi in Ziman 8(3)1 of Non-ZA
khatauni. The photocopy of the questionnaire from record room is being annexed
herewith Annexure No.3 to this writ petition."
10. On being asked regarding the entry indicated in Para 4 of writ petition, quoted above, learned
Senior Advocate, appearing for petitioners had stated that typographical error regarding the entry,
inadvertently, could not be corrected while filing the present petition and this entry should be read
as Ziman 8(iii)(a)(1).
11. Before proceeding further on the facts of the case, this Court finds it appropriate to indicate
relevant part of para(s) of U.P. Land Records Manual i.e. Para 124 (Applicable for Arrangements of
holdings in Agra) and Para 124-A (Applicable for Arrangement of buildings in Avadh) and Para
A-124 (Applicable to the areas over which Act of 1950 applies).
"124. Arrangements of holdings in Agra.-In Agra the arrangements of land within
each patti or khewat-khata in the khatauni will be as follows:

12. The entry (14)(iii)(a)(1) in Para 124 and entry 8(iii)(a)(1) in Para 124-A and entry 5(iii)(a)(1) in
Para A-124 indicates that the land with any of these entries would be the land under management of
the Forest Department.
13. Further, according to the 'Note' appended to the provision(s), referred hereinabove, Sal (Sakhu)
trees, which were/are situated and were about 80-100 year old at the time of submission of report

dated 07.06.1999 by the Commissioner, Lucknow Division, Lucknow and at present the same would
be about 105-125 year old, would be covered under expression "Timber Tree".
14. In view of aforesaid, the entire Gata/Plot No. 21 area 431.61 acres in 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) was
under the management/control of Forest Department, even if it is presumed that in 1356 Fasli (1949
A.D.) the land was recorded in the name of Raja Brijraj Bahadur Singh.
15. Now, the question is as to whether any right would be available to any person over the land of
aforesaid nature or over the land with aforesaid category/entry i.e. 8(iii)(a)(1) in Para 124 or
5(iii)(a)(1) in Para A-124. This question has no more res-integra.
16. In the case of Gyanendra Singh and Another vs. Additional Commissioner, Agra Division, Agra
and Others; 2003 (95) RD 286, while dealing with the matter related to Section 198(4) of the Act of
1950 this Court dismissed the petition after taking note of entry in the revenue record i.e. "Jungle
Dhak" and Section 132 of the Act of 1950 and also the submissions of learned counsel for the
petitioners that opportunity was not provided. As per this judgment, the land recorded as "Jungle
Dhak" would be covered under Section 132 and accordingly no right would be available to any
person over such type of lands.
"5. Both the courts below have recorded finding that all the three plots were recorded
as "Jangal Dhaka". The word "Jangal Dhaka" means Dhaka Forest, Dhaka is a kind of
small tree having large leaves. He entry of the aforesaid plot clearly indicates that the
said plots are a kind of forest recorded as Dhaka Forest. The use and utility of forest
cannot be denied. Existence of forest are beneficial for human life and environment.
There cannot be any denial that forest land is a land of public utility. Section 132 of
U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act mentions about the land in
which bhumidhari rights shall not accrue. Section 132 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition
and Land Reforms Act is extracted below:-
"132. Land in which (bhumidhari) rights shall not accrue.--Notwithstanding anything
contained in Section 131, but without prejudice to the provisions of Section 19,
(bhumidhari) rights shall not accrue in:
(a) pasture lands or lands covered by water and used for the purposes of growing
singhara or other produce or land in the bed of a river and used for casual or
occasional cultivation;
(b) such tracts of shifting or unstable cultivation as the State Government may specify
by notification in the Gazette; and
(c) lands declared by the State Government by notification in the official Gazette, to
be intended or set apart for taungya plantation or grove lands of a (Gaon Sabha) or a
local authority or land acquired or held for a public purpose and in particular and
without prejudice to the generality of this clause:-

(i) land set apart for military encamping grounds;
(ii) lands included within railway or canal boundaries;
(iii) lands situate within the limits of any cantonment;
(iv) lands included in sullage farms or trenching grounds belonging as such to a local
authority;
(v) lands acquired by a town improvement trust in accordance with a scheme
sanctioned under Section 42 of U.P. Town Improvement Act, 1919 (U.P. Act VII of
1919), or by a municipality for purpose mentioned in clause (a) or clause (c) of
Section 8 of the U.P. Municipalities Act, 1916 (U.P. Act VII of 1916); and
(vi) lands set apart for public purposes under the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act,
1953 (U.P. Act No. V of 1954)."
6. The sub-clause (3) of Section 132 includes land held for a public purpose on
which bhumidhari rights shall not accrue. The aforesaid three plots being recorded as "Dhaka
Jangal" were covered by land as enumerated in Section 132 and lease of bhumidhari rights with
non-transferable right cannot be granted on the said plots. No error has been committed by the
courts below in cancelling the lease granted in favour of the petitioners. The submission of
petitioners is that other persons have also been granted lease of "Dhaka Jangal", hence petitioners
have been discriminated in so far as the lease of other persons have not been cancelled and the
petitioners have only been singled out for cancellation. The counsel for the petitioners has raised the
submission based on discrimination. As noted above, lease of "Dhaka Jangal" is not permissible in
accordance with Section 132 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act and the fact that
leases were granted to certain other persons cannot validate the lease of the petitioners which was in
violation of Section 132 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. The plea of
discrimination is not available in a case where the benefit which was taken by other persons cannot
be said to be in accordance with law. Apex Court in Chandigarh Administration v. Jagjit Singh,
(1995) 1 SCC 745, held that mere fact that the respondent has passed a particular order in the case of
another person similarly situated can never be the ground for issuing a writ in favour of the
petitioner on the plea of discrimination in case the order in favour of other persons is found to be
contrary to law or not warranted in the facts of this case. Following was laid down in paragraph 8:-
"8. We are of the opinion that the basis or the principle, if it can be called one, on
which the writ petition has been allowed by the High Court is unsustainable in law
and indefensible in principle. Since we have come across many such instances, we
think it necessary to deal with such pleas at a little length. Generally speaking, the
mere fact that the respondent authority has passed a particular order in the case of
another person similarly situated can never be the ground for issuing a writ in favour
of the petitioner on the plea of discrimination. The order in favour of the other
person might be legal and valid or it might not be. That has to be investigated first
Mahesh Chandra Saxena And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru. Collector, Kheri And ... on 16 July, 2024

31

before it can be directed to be followed in the case of the petitioner. If the order in
favour of the other person is found to be contrary to law or not warranted in the facts
and circumstances of his case, it is obvious that such illegal or unwarranted order
cannot be made the basis of issuing a writ compelling the respondent authority to
repeat the illegality or to pass another unwarranted order. The extraordinary and
discretionary power of the High Court cannot be exercised for such a purpose. Merely
because the respondent authority has passed one illegal/unwarranted order, it does
not entitle the High Court to compel the authority to repeat that illegality over again
and again. The illegal/unwarranted action must be correct, if it can be done according
to law indeed, wherever it is possible, the Court should direct the appropriate
authority to correct such wrong orders in accordance with law but even if it cannot be
corrected, it is difficult to see how it can be made a basis for its repetition. By refusing
to direct the respondent authority to repeat the illegality; the Court is not condoning
the earlier illegal act/order nor can such illegal order constitute the basis for a
legitimate complaint of discrimination. Giving effect to such pleas would be
prejudicial to the interests of law and will do incalculable mischief to public interest.
It will be a negation of law and the rule of law............."
7. Thus the submission of counsel for the petitioners that other persons have been granted leases of
plots recorded as "Jangal Dhaka" is not relevant nor can validate the lease of petitioners. No error
has been committed by the respondents in cancelling the lease of the petitioners.
8. The next submission of the petitioners is to the effect that Additional Collector is not Collector
within the meaning of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act and has no jurisdiction to
cancel the lease. Assuming without admitting that power to cancel the lease only vests with
Collector, this Court will not exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution to
interfere with an order of Additional Collector, the effect of which is to restore the illegal lease
granted to the petitioners. This Court while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution will not exercise its jurisdiction in a manner the effect of which is to restore illegal
order.
9. The Apex Court in Gadde Venkateswara Rao v. Government of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1966 SC
828, has observed that while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226, High Court will not exercise
its jurisdiction, the effect of which is to restore an illegal order. The relevant paragraph of the
aforesaid judgment is extracted below:
"(17) The result of the discussion may be stated thus. The Primary Health Centre was
not permanently located at Dharmajigudem. The representatives of the said village
did not comply with the necessary conditions for such location. The Panchayat
Samithi finally cancelled its earlier resolutions which they were entitled to do and
passed a resolution for locating the Primary Health Centre permanently at
Lingapalem. Both the orders of the Government, namely the order dated March 7,
1962, and that dated April 18, 1963, were not legally passed; the former, because it
was made without giving notice to the Panchayat Samithi, and the latter, because the

32

Government had no power under Section 72 of the Act to review an order made
under Section 62 of the Act and also because it did not give notice to the
representatives of Dharmajigudem village. In those circumstances, was it a case for
the High Court to interfere in its discretion and quash the order of the Government
dated April 18, 1963? If the High Court had quashed the said order, it would have
restored an illegal order, it would have given the health centre to a village contrary to
the valid resolutions passed by the Panchayat Samithi. The High Court, therefore, in
our view, rightly refused to exercise its extraordinary discretionary power in the
circumstances of the case."
10. Both the submissions of counsel for the petitioners being without any substance, the orders
impugned in the writ petition need to interference by this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India."
17. This Court in the case of Sharad Kumar Dwivedi vs. State of U.P. & Ors. 2022 SCC OnLine All
466; took note of relevant provisions including Para A-124 of U.P. Land Records Manual, Section
117 and 132 of the Act of 1950 and Section 101 of U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 (in short "Code of 2006")
and also relevant pronouncements/reports on the issue including the judgment passed in the case of
Gyanendra Singh (supra) and thereafter held that the land recorded as "Jungle Dhak" is a public
utility land. The relevant part of the judgment reads as under:-
"Relevant Provisions:--
35. Para A-124 of the U.P. Land Records Manual provides the classes of the tenure or
categories of land, which reads as under:--
"A-124. Arrangement of holdings : - The arrangement of land within each village in
the khatauni shall be as follows:--
Part I= (1-A) (1-B) (5) Culturable Land--

(2) vested in the Gram Sabha."
36. Section 117 of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950 is in respect of the vesting of certain lands etc. in
Gram Sabhas and other local authorities. Section 117(6) of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950 reads as
under:--
"117. Vesting of certain lands, etc. in Gaon Sabhas and other Local Authorities.
(1) ...
(2) ...
(6) The State Government may at any time, [by general or special order to be
published in the manner prescribed], amend or cancel any [declaration, notification

case of any Gaon Sabha or other local authority and resume such thing and whenever
the State Government so resumes any such things, the Gaon Sabha or other local
authority, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive and be paid compensation
on account only of the development, if any, effected by it in or over that things:
Provided that the State Government may after such resumption make a fresh
declaration under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) vesting the thing resumed in the
same or any other local authority (including a Gaon Sabha), and the provisions of
sub-sections (3), (4) and (5), as the case may be, shall mutatis mutandis, apply to
such declaration."
37. Section 132 of U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950 provides the category of lands in which bhumidhari
rights shall not accrue. Relevant provisions of Section 132 of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950 read as
under:--
"132. Land in which [bhumidhari] rights shall not accrue.- Notwithstanding anything
contained in Section 131, but without prejudice to the provisions of Section 19,
[bhumidhari] rights shall not accrue in--
(a) pasture lands or lands covered by water and used for the purpose of growing
singhara or other produce or land in the bed of a river and used for casual or
occasional cultivation;
.....................
(c) lands declared by the Slate Government by notification in the Official Gazette, to be intended or

....................
(vi) lands set apart for public purposes under the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 (U.P. Act
V of 1954).]"
38. Section 101 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 permits the exchange of land by a Bhumidhar with
prior permission in writing of the Sub-Divisional Officer. However, it further provides that the
Sub-Divisional Officer shall refuse permission for exchange inter alia in respect of the land in which
bhumidhari rights do not accrue. Section 101 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 reads as under:--
"101 Exchange.- (1) Notwithstanding anything in section 77 of this Code, any
bhumidhar may with prior permission in writing of the Sub-Divisional Officer
exchange his land with the land- (a) held by another bhumidhar; or (b) entrusted or
deemed to be entrusted to any Gram Panchayat or a local authority under section 59.
(2) The Sub-Divisional Officer shall refuse permission under sub-section (1) in the
following cases, namely- (a) if the exchange is not necessary for the consolidation of
holdings or securing convenience in cultivation; or (b) if the difference between the
valuation, determined in the manner prescribed, of the lands given and received in
exchange exceeds ten per 52 cent of the lower valuation; or (c) if the difference
between the areas of the land given and received in exchange exceeds twenty-five per
cent of the lesser area; or (d) in the case of land referred to in clause (b) of
sub-section (1), if it is reserved for planned use, or is land in which bhumidhari rights
do not accrue; or (e) if the land is not located in same or adjacent village of the same
tahsil : Provided that the State Government may permit the exchange with land
mentioned in clause (d) aforesaid, on the conditions and in the manner, prescribed.
(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to empower any person to exchange his
undivided interest in any holding, except where such exchange is in between two or
more co-sharers. (4) Nothing in the Registration Act, 1908 (Act No. 16 of 1908), shall
apply to an exchange in accordance with this section."
Analysis:
39. It is a trite law that if a writ petition filed by a person raises question of public importance
involving exercise of power by men in authority, then it is the duty of the Court to enquire into the
matter. The legal fraud played by the public authority for benefit of the private persons at the
expense of public at large cannot be condoned. In the present case, even if it is believed that the
petitioner has some personal grudge or score to settle with opposite party no. 5 and his sons, the
cause espoused by him in this writ petition is of greater public importance and, therefore, this Court
in its order dated 18.3.2021 observed that looking at the facts of the case, this Court may treat this
writ petition as Public Interest Litigation suo motu.
40. Supreme Court in the case of Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta Congress v. State of Madhya
Pradesh, (2011) 5 SCC 29 in paragraph 80 held as under:--

"80. The challenge to the locus standi of the appellant merits rejection because it has
not been disputed that the appellant is a public spirited organization and has
challenged other similar allotment made in favour of Punjabi Samaj, Bhopal, That
apart, as held in Shivajirao Nilangekar Patil v. Mahesh Madhav Gosavi, (1987) 1 SCC
227 even if a person files a writ petition for vindication of his private interest but
raises question of public importance involving exercise of power by men in authority
then it is the duty of the Court to enquire into the matter."
41. The State or its instrumentalities cannot give largesse to any person according to the sweet will
and whims of the authorities of the State. Every action/decision of the State and its
agencies/instrumentalities to give largesse or confer benefit must be founded on a sound,
transparent, discernible and well-defined policy. Paragraph 65 of the said judgment reads as
Under:--
" 6 5 .  W h a t  n e e d s  t o  b e  e m p h a s i z e d  i s  t h a t  t h e  S t a t e  a n d / o r  i t s
agencies/instrumentalities cannot give largesse to any person according to the sweet
will and whims of the political entities and/or officers of the State. Every
action/decision of the State and/or its agencies/instrumentalities to give largesse or
confer benefit must be founded on a sound, transparent, discernible and well defined
policy, which shall be made known to the public by publication in the Official Gazette
and other recognized modes of publicity and such policy must be
implemented/executed by adopting a non-discriminatory and non-arbitrary method
irrespective of the class or category of persons proposed to be benefitted by the
policy. The distribution of largesse like allotment of land, grant of quota, permit
licence etc. by the State and its agencies/instrumentalities should always be done in a
fair and equitable manner and the element of favoritism or nepotism shall not
influence the exercise of discretion, if any, conferred upon the particular functionary
or officer of the State."
42. This Court in Gyanendra Singh v. Additional Commissioner, Agra Division, Agra, (2003) 95 RD
286 has held that the land recorded as "Jangal Dhak' is a forest land and is a public utility land and
same cannot be transferred by way of lease, sale etc and no bhumidhari rights shall accrue in respect
of the said land. These lands are saved under Section 132 of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950. This
Court considering the provisions of Section 132 of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950 held that lands
recorded as "Jangal Dhak' are covered by the lands enumerated under Section 132 U.P.Z.A. & L.R.
Act, 1950 and the same cannot be transferred in favour of anyone.
43. This Court defined in the said judgment that "Jangal Dhak' means "Dhaka Forest'. Dhaka is a
kind of small tree having large leaves. It has been held that the entry of the land as "Jangal Dhak'
would mean that it is a forest land and forest is beneficial for human life and environment.
Therefore, the land in the category of "Jangal Dhak' is a public utility land, in respect of which no
bhumidhari right can accrue. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the said judgment read as under:--

"7. The sub-clause (3) of Section 132 includes land held for a public purpose on which
bhumidhari rights shall not accrue. The aforesaid three plots being recorded as
"Dhaka Jangal" were covered by land as enumerated in Section 132 and lease of
bhumidhari rights with non-transferable right cannot be granted on the said plots.
No error has been committed by the courts below in cancelling the lease granted in
favour of the petitioners. The submission of petitioners is that other persons have
also been granted lease of "Dhaka Jangal", hence petitioners have been discriminated
in so far as the lease of other persons have not been cancelled and the petitioners
have only been singled out for cancellation. The counsel for the petitioners has raised
the submission based on discrimination. As noted above, lease of "Dhaka Jangal" is
not permissible in accordance with Section 132 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land
Reforms Act and the fact that leases were granted to certain other persons cannot
validate the lease of the petitioners which was in violation of Section 132 of U.P.
Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. The plea of discrimination is not
available in a case where the benefit which was taken by other persons cannot be said
to be in accordance with law. Apex Court in Chandigarh Administration v. Jagjit
Singh, (1995) 1 SCC 745, held that mere fact that the respondent has passed a
particular order in the case of another person similarly situated can never be the
ground for issuing a writ in favour of the petitioner on the plea of discrimination in
case the order in favour of other persons is found to be contrary to law or not
warranted in the facts of this case. Following was laid down in paragraph 8:
"8. We are of the opinion that the basis or the principle, if it can be called one, on
which the writ petition has been allowed by the High Court is unsustainable in law
and indefensible in principle. Since we have come across many such instances, we
think it necessary to deal with such pleas at a little length. Generally speaking, the
mere fact that the respondent authority has passed a particular order in the case of
another person similarly situated can never be the ground for issuing a writ in favour
of the petitioner on the plea of discrimination. The order in favour of the other
person might be legal and valid or it might not be. That has to be investigated first
before it can be directed to be followed in the case of the petitioner. If the order in
favour of the other person is found to be contrary to law or not warranted in the facts
and circumstances of his case, it is obvious that such illegal or unwarranted order
cannot be made the basis of issuing a writ compelling the respondent authority to
repeat the illegality or to pass another unwarranted order. The extraordinary and
discretionary power of the High Court cannot be exercised for such a purpose. Merely
because the respondent authority has passed one illegal/unwarranted order, it does
not entitle the High Court to compel the authority to repeat that illegality over again

legitimate complaint of discrimination. Giving effect to such pleas would be
prejudicial to the interests of law and will do incalculable mischief to public interest.
It will be a negation of law and the rule of law............."
44. Thus, I do not find any substance in the submission of Sri. Mohd. Arif Khan, learned Senior
Advocate that the land in question, which was recorded as "Jangal Dhak' is not a public utility land
and, therefore, there was no bar under Section 132 of the U.P.Z.A. & L.R. Act, 1950."
18. In Writ - C No.1001953 of 2006 (Ramesh vs. Additional Commissioner, Lucknow And 2 Ors.),
this Court held that the land recorded as "Jungle Dhak" would be covered under Section 132 of the
Act of 1950 and according to this judgment, the land recorded as "Timber Trees" as also "Jungle
Dhak" would be a public utility land and no right would be available to any person over such type of
lands.
19. Undisputedly, the land earlier was recorded under category/entry 8(iii)(a)(1) of Para 124 of U.P.
Land Records Manual and subsequently after enforcement of the Act of 1950, the entire land was
recorded under categories/entries indicated in Para A-124 of U.P. Land Records Manual. It is for the
reason that in 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.), some portion of Gata/Plot No. 21 was recorded as 'Imarti
Lakdi Ka Jungle', under category/entry 5(iii)(a)(1) and out of total area i.e. 431.46 acres of this land
35 acres were recorded under category/entry 5-A, which means "Occupiers of lands without title
when there is no one already recorded in column 5 of the khasra" and earlier to the same i.e. in 1346
Fasli (1939 A.D.) and 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.), the land was recorded under category 8(iii)(a)(1),
which means "the land manged by Forest Department".
20. It would not be out of place to indicate here that in terms of Section 20-A inserted in Indian
Forest Act, 1927, vide U.P. Act 23 of 1965, no right would be available to any person over any "Forest
Land or Waste Land". Section 20-A is extracted hereinunder:-
"20-A. Certain forest land or waste land when deemed to be reserved forest.--(1)
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any other law for the time being
in force, including the Merged States (Laws) Act, 1949 or the U.P. Merged States
(Application of Laws) Act, 1950, or any order issued thereunder, any forest- land or
waste-land in a merged State which immediately before the date of merger
(hereinafter in this section referred to as the said date),-
(a) was deemed to be a reserved forest under any enactment in force in that State, or
(b) was recognized or declared by the Ruler of such State as reserved forest under any
law (including any enactment, rule, regulation, order, notification, custom or usage

done before the commencement of the Indian Forest (Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1965, which
was not an offence before such commencement."
21. Regarding expression(s) 'Forest' and 'Forest Land', the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of T.N.
Godavaraman Thirumulpad etc. vs. Union of India and Others; (1997) 2 SCC 267, held as under:-
"4. The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 was enacted with a view to check further
deforestation which ultimately results in ecological imbalance; and therefore, the
provisions made therein for the conservation of forests and for matters connected
therewith, must apply to all forests irrespective of the nature of ownership or
classification thereof. The word "forest" must be understood according to its
dictionary meaning. This description covers all statutorily recognised forests,
whether designated as reserved, protected or otherwise for the purpose of Section
2(i) of the Forest Conservation Act. The term "forest land", occurring in Section 2,
will not only include "forest" as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area
recorded as forest in the Government record irrespective of the ownership. This is
how it has to be understood for the purpose of Section 2 of the Act. The provisions
enacted in the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for the conservation of forests and the
matters connected therewith must apply clearly to all forests so understood
irrespective of the ownership or classification thereof. This aspect has been made
abundantly clear in the decisions of this Court in Ambica Quarry Works v. State of
Gujarat [(1987) 1 SCC 213] , Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v. State of
U.P. [1989 Supp (1) SCC 504] and recently in the order dated 29-11-1996 (Supreme
Court Monitoring Committee v. Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority [ WP
(C) No 749 of 1995 decided on 29-11-1996] ). The earlier decision of this Court
in State of Bihar v. Banshi Ram Modi [(1985) 3 SCC 643] has, therefore, to be
understood in the light of these subsequent decisions. We consider it necessary to
reiterate this settled position emerging from the decisions of this Court to dispel the
doubt, if any, in the perception of any State Government or authority. This has
become necessary also because of the stand taken on behalf of the State of Rajasthan,
even at this late stage, relating to permissions granted for mining in such area which
is clearly contrary to the decisions of this Court. It is reasonable to assume that any
State Government which has failed to appreciate the correct position in law so far,
will forthwith correct its stance and take the necessary remedial measures without
any further delay."
22. Upon conjoint reading of above indicated entries and note appended to the same as also the
observation made in the judgment(s), referred above and the spirit of Section 20-A of the Act of
1927, this Court is of the view that no right would be available to any person over the 'land' if the
same is recorded in terms of category/entry 14(iii)(a)(1) in Para 124 or 8(iii)(a)(1) in Para 124-A or
5(iii)(a)(1) in Para A-124 of U.P. Land Records Manual.
23. Now, the issue before this Court is as to whether any right would be available to the petitioner(s)
based upon Section 20(b) of the Act of 1950 and the revenue entries indicated in (i) Khatauni of
Mahesh Chandra Saxena And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru. Collector, Kheri And ... on 16 July, 2024

and (iii) Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.).
24. The aforesaid is in view of the claim of the petitioners, which can be deduced from the following
facts:-
25. As per petitioners, in 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.), the land in issue i.e. Gata/Plot No. 21 area 431.61
acres was recorded in the name of Raja Brijraj Bahadur Singh under Category 8(3)1. Para 4 of Writ
Petition, at the cost of repetition, is extracted hereinunder:-
"4. That the disputed property was entered in the ownership of Raja Brijraj Bahadur
of Jhandi as proprietor /khewatdar/Zamindar of Mohal Mustahkam village Alenganj
Pargana Bhud District Kheri, before abolition of Zamindari in Uttar Pradesh. Before
1356 F Gata no. 21 area 431.61 acr. was entered as owner with possession in the
khewat khatauni of Raja Brijraj Bahadur of Jhandi in Ziman 8(3)1 of Non-ZA
khatauni. The photocopy of the questionnaire from record room is being annexed
herewith Annexure No. 3 to this writ petition."
26. As per petitioners, in 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) on account of possession of over 31.35 acres of
Gata/Plot No. 21 the names of predecessor-in-interest of petitioners were recorded and Gata/Plot
No. 21 was re-numbered/sub-divided as Gata/ Plot No. 21, 21/2 to 21/7 and accordingly Gata/Plot
No. 21 area 393.91 acres recorded under Category/Entry 8(iii)(a)(1) in Para 124-A, which is similar
to category/entry 5(iii)(a)(1) in Para A-124 of U.P. Land Records Manual, and 31.35 acres of
Gata/Plot No. 21 was recorded under Category 5-A in Para 124-A of U.P. Land Records Manual,
which means "Occupiers of lands without title when there is no one already recorded in column 5 of
the khasra".
27. Relevant details of entries (as appears from Annexure No. 4 to the petition), which is the copy of
Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.), wherein names of predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners
were mentioned, are indicated as under:-

28. In order to decide the issue aforesaid, the relevant part of the Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.)
i.e. where the division of Gata/Plot No.21 has been indicated, is also extracted hereinunder:-
29. From the persons recorded in Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) the petitioners purchased the
land in issue, which in 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) was part of Gata/Plot No. 21 area 431.61 acre under
Category 8(iii)(a)(1) of U.P. Land Record Manual, according to which, the land was under the

30. The entries in revenue records favourable to the petitioners were undisputed till Forest
Department raised its claim over the land in issue.
31. The Forest Department for the first time disputed this entry in the year 1995. On an objection
being raised regarding the entries, the S.D.M, Gola Gokaran Nath, District-Kheri sought report from
the revenue Official/Tehsildar and in response, the report dated 16.05.1995 was submitted. This
report says that present Gata No.22 (earlier Gata/Plot Nos.21/2 to 21/7) is not reserved forest. The
report is annexed as Annexure No.10 to the present petition and being relevant, the same is
reproduced hereinunder:-

32. It reflects from the above quoted report that the same was prepared after taking note of the
notifications dated 29.03.1954 and 26.04.1968 issued under Section 4 and 20 of the Act of 1927,
respectively, which are also part of the record as Annexure No.8.

33. From a bare perusal of the report, quoted above and the notifications referred above, it is
apparent that old Gata/Plot Nos.21/1 to 21/7 were not acquired for reserve forest under the Act of
1927. However, the admitted fact in the 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) and prior to that the total area i.e.
431.61 acre of Gata/Plot No.21 was recorded under Category/Entry 8(iii)(a)(1) and out of this, only
over 31.35 acres, the petitioners are claiming their rights and rest of the land i.e. 393.91 acres
belongs to the Forest Department undisputedly.
34. The S.D.M, District-Kheri, thereafter, by order dated 30.06.1995 rejected the claim of the Forest
Department. The basis of rejection, as appears from the order of the S.D.M., Gola Gokaran Nath,
District-Kheri, is the report of the Tehsildar dated 16.05.1995.
35. After the order dated 30.06.1995, the Forest Department again raised its claim over the land in
issue and the claim of the Forest Department was allowed vide order dated 28.10.1999 passed by
S.D.M, Gola, Gokaran Nath in Case No.118/Allenganj-Forest Department-Forged entry 99, dated
28.10.1999. The operative portion of order dated 28.10.1999 is extracted hereinbelow:-

authority by means of the Revision No.53 (LR) 1999-2000 (Mahesh Chandra Saxena vs. State of
U.P/Forest Department) and this Revision was allowed vide order dated 11.10.2000. The operative

37. The operative portion of the order dated 11.10.2000, quoted above, indicates that the revisional
authority interfered in the order dated 28.10.1999 passed by S.D.M. Gola Gokaran, whereby the
claim of the Forest Department was allowed, and remanded the matter back for deciding afresh on
merits after impleading Gaon Sabha as a party to the proceedings.
38. Thereafter, the petitioners challenged both the order(s) dated 28.10.1999 and 11.10.2000 by
means of the Misc. Single No.-174 of 2001 (Mahesh Chandra Saxena And Others vs. State of U.P.
and Others). The petition referred by the petitioners was finally allowed vide order dated
12.09.2014. The relevant portion of the judgment of this Court dated 12.09.2014 reads as under:-
"3. Divisional Forest Officer (respondent-4) moved an application for deleting the
names of the petitioners from the aforesaid khatas. It has been stated in the
application that the land in dispute was Forest land and covered with dense forest of
old 'sal' trees. The names of the petitioners/ their transferors were recorded by
making forgery in the revenue records, over it. On this application, a report has been
called for from Tahsildar, who submitted his report and Up-Ziladhikari, by the order
dated 28.10.1999 deleted the names of the petitioners from the land in dispute
holding that it were Forest land and the names of the transferors of the petitioners
were recorded by making forgery in the revenue records. The petitioners filed a
revision (registered as Revision No. 53 (LR) of 1999-2000) from the aforesaid order.
The revision was heard by Board of Revenue U.P., who by order dated 11.10.2000
held that the petitioners failed to prove satisfactorily that after date of vesting how
their transferors were recorded over the land in dispute. Gaon Sabha was not
impleaded as party although after date of vesting, property appeared to have been
vested in it and why it had failed to protect the public property. Up-Ziladhikari
passed the order in violation of principles of natural justice. On these findings, the
order of Up-Ziladhikari, dated 28.10.1999 was set aside and the matter was
remanded to Up-Ziladhikari for fresh decision on merit after impleading gaon sabha
and giving the parties an opportunity to adduce their evidence and examining
original record. Hence this writ petition has been filed.
4. A complaint was also made to State Government, in this respect. On which
Principal Secretary, Forest Department, Govt. of U.P., by order dated 29.04.1999
called for a report from Commissioner, Lucknow. In pursuance of the order dated
29.04.1999, the Commissioner heard the matter and also made spot inspection and
after examining the evidence of the parties as well as original revenue records prior to
the consolidation operation, submitted his report dated 07.06.1999. The
Commissioner, in his report found that in settlement khatauni of 1346 F, plot 21
(area 436.41 acre) (a part of which is now disputed land) was recorded in khata 66 in
ziman 8 (3) as "Krishi Yogy Banjar Bhumi and Imarti Lakari Ke Van" in gair
ehatimali mohal and quality of soil was mentioned as 'jangal'. In 1354 F an area of
831.46 acre of plot 21 was recorded in khata 170 as mustahkam in ziman 8 (3) as
"Krishi Yogy Banjar Bhumi and Imarti Lakari Ka Jangal". Same entry was repeated in
1356 F khatauni in khata 211. For the first time, in 1359 F, plot 21 was sub-divided

and (i) plot 21/1 (area 393.91 acre) was recorded in khata 98 in ziman 8 (3) (1) as
"Imarti Lakari Ke Jangal", (ii) plot 21/2 (area 7.85 acre) was recorded in khata 89 in
ziman 5-A as "Occupiers of land without title when there is no one already recorded
in column 5 of khasra" in the name of Dal Singh, with period of cultivation of one
year. (iii) plot 21/3 (area 8.60 acre) was recorded in khata 90 in ziman 5-A in the
name of Gopal Singh, with period of cultivation of one year. (iv) plot 21/4 (area 2.50
acre) was recorded in khata 91 in ziman 5-A in the name of Buddhu, with period of
cultivation of one year. (v) plot 21/5 (area 8.60 acre) was recorded in khata 92 in
ziman 5-A in the name of Surta, with period of cultivation of one year. (vi) plot 21/6
(area 10.00 acre) was recorded in khata 93 in ziman 5-A in the name of Gopal Singh,
with period of cultivation of one year. (vii) plot 21/7 (area 2.60 acre) was recorded in
khata 94 in ziman 5-A in the name of Amru, with period of cultivation of one year. In
khasra 1359 F area of plot 21/1 was recorded as 393.91 acre cutting 431.46 acre and
its deducted area were recorded in plots 21/2 to 21/7 as mentioned in the khatauni, in
the names of different persons and cultivation of barely was shown but in the remark
column entry of "Imarti Lakari Ke Jangal" has been mentioned. The Commissioner
further found that this entry was made in different hand writing than the hand
writing of then patwari, who had prepared regular khasra. In goswara total area of
barely crop was shown as 245.72 acre in plot 21. The names of the persons recorded
over plots 21/2 to 21/7 were recorded as sirdar in 1360 F. Same entry continued in
1370 F-1372 F khatauni and maintained during consolidation. After consolidation
new plot number 22-ka to 22-chha was recorded of old plots 21/1 to 21/7. The
petitioners purchased the aforesaid land in 1997 and on the basis of sale deed their
names were mutated.
5. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that the predecessors of the petitioners
were in cultivatory possession over the land in dispute since 1358 F and their names
were recorded in settlement khatauni 1359 F. They acquired sirdari right under
Section 20 (b) read with Rule 177-A of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 and the Rules framed in
it, being recorded occupants in 1359 F. The village has undergone in to consolidation
operation. Entry in their favour was maintained during consolidation. The
predecessors acquired bhumidhari right under Section 131 as amended by U.P. Act
No. 1 of 1977. The petitioners are bonafide transferees. Their names were also
mutated in the proceedings under Section 34 of U.P. Land Revenue Act, 1901. Claim
of the respondents, if any, is barred under Section 49 of U.P. Consolidation of
Holdings Act, 1953. In any case, long standing entry coming since 1359 F and
maintained during consolidation cannot be deleted by an administrative order that
too without providing any opportunity of hearing, as held by Board of Revenue U.P.
in Hira Lal Vs. Aharwa, 1966 RD 10, Bahadur Vs. State of U.P., 1980 RD 1 (FB) and
this Court in Maha Lakshmi Land and Finance Company (P) Ltd. Versus Board of
Revenue U.P., 1997 (15) LCD 273. He submitted that in the absence of any
notification under Section 20 of Indian Forest Act, the land cannot be treated as
Forest land and Forest Department of State of U.P. has nothing to do with the land in
dispute. He submitted that in the absence of any notification under Section 117 of
Mahesh Chandra Saxena And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru. Collector, Kheri And ... on 16 July, 2024

U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951, Gaon Sabha has nothing to do in the matter, as held by
Supreme Court in U.P. State Sugar Corporation Ltd. Vs. Dy. Director of
Consolidation, AIR 2000 SC 878. Gaon Sabha did not raise any objection against the
petitioners, either before consolidation or during consolidation. Right of Gaon Sabha,
if any, is barred under Section 11-A and 49 of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act,
1953, as held by Division Bench of this Court in Gaon Sabha Kudra Vs. Noor Mohd.
Khan, 1975 RD 61 (DB). Board of Revenue has illegally directed for impleading Gaon
Sabha and deciding the dispute afresh, which is merely harassment of the petitioners
for nothing. Impugned orders are illegal, without jurisdiction and liable to be set
aside.
6. I have considered the arguments of the counsel for the parties and examined the
record. A perusal of the report of the Commissioner shows that in settlement
khatauni of 1346 F, plot 21 (area 436.41 acre) was recorded in khata 66 in ziman 8 (3)
as "Krishi Yogy Banjar Bhumi and Imarti Lakari Ke Van" in gair ehatimali mohal and
quality of soil was mentioned as 'jangal'. In 1354 F an area of 831.46 acre of plot 21
was recorded in khata 170 as mustahkam in ziman 8 (3) as "Krishi Yogy Banjar
Bhumi and Imarti Lakari Ka Jangal". Same entry was repeated in 1356 F khatauni in
khata 211. For the first time, in 1359 F, plot 21 was sub-divided and (i) plot 21/1 (area
393.91 acre) was recorded in khata 98 in ziman 8 (3) (1) as "Imarti Lakari Ke Jangal",
(ii) plot 21/2 (area 7.85 acre) was recorded in khata 89 in ziman 5-A as "Occupiers of
land without title when there is no one already recorded in column 5 of khasra" in the
name of Dal Singh, with period of cultivation of one year. (iii) plot 21/3 (area 8.60
acre) was recorded in khata 90 in ziman 5-A in the name of Gopal Singh, with period
of cultivation of one year. (iv) plot 21/4 (area 2.50 acre) was recorded in khata 91 in
ziman 5-A in the name of Buddhu, with period of cultivation of one year. (v) plot 21/5
(area 8.60 acre) was recorded in khata 92 in ziman 5-A in the name of Surta, with
period of cultivation of one year. (vi) plot 21/6 (area 10.00 acre) was recorded in
khata 93 in ziman 5-A in the name of Gopal Singh, with period of cultivation of one
year. (vii) plot 21/7 (area 2.60 acre) was recorded in khata 94 in ziman 5-A in the
name of Amru, with period of cultivation of one year. In khasra 1359 F, area of plot
21/1 was recorded as 393.91 acre cutting 431.46 acre and its deducted area were
recorded in plots 21/2 to 21/7 as mentioned in the khatauni, in the names of different
persons. Although cultivation of barely was shown but in the remark column entry of
"Imarti Lakari Ke Jangal" has been mentioned. The Commissioner found that this
entry was made in different hand writing than the hand writing of then patwari, who
had prepared regular khasra. In goswara total area of barely crop was shown as
245.72 acre in plot 21, which does not tally with the entry of khatauni.
7. According to Forest Department of State of U.P., the entire area of old plot 21 is
still dense forest of 'sal' timber trees. Agricultural activities are not going on in any
part of it. According to the petitioners, land recorded in their names are agricultural
land. Entry in ziman 5-A, in Awadh is for "occupiers of land without title, where there
is no one already recorded in column 5 of the khasra. Entry in ziman 8 (a), in Awadh

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76142227/

is for "Forest of timber trees". Even in khatauni 1359 F, in remark column, entry of
"Imarti Lakari Ke Jangal" has been mentioned. If there had been dense forest then,
there could have been no agricultural activities. The petitioners claim title under
Section 20(b) of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951, as their predecessors were "recorded
occupants" in 1359 F khatauni. A special Bench consisting of five Hon'ble Judges of
this Court in Basdeo vs. Board of Revenue, U.P. 1974 R.D. 188 (SB) and Supreme
Court in Ram Harakh vs. Hamid Ahmad Khan (1998) 7 SCC 488 held that in order to
get right under Section 20(b) of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951, entry in 1359F must be
genuine and made according to the provisions of Land Record Manual and not a fake
entry. Till today, this issue has not been decided by any court/authority after hearing
the parties. In case, this entry was not genuine, the property in dispute was vested in
State of U.P. under U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 and only on the basis of subsequent
possession, no right can be derived on it.
8. Admittedly no proceeding for correction of land record was taken under U.P.
Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 and only the prior entries were maintained. The
counsel for the petitioners submitted that after consolidation, their right cannot be
challenged in view of Section 49 of the Act, which is quoted below:-
"49. Bar to civil jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law
for the time being in force, the declaration and adjudication of rights of tenure
holders in respect of land lying in an area, for which a notification has been issued
under sub-section (2) of Section 4 or adjudication of any other rights arising out of
consolidation proceedings and in regard to which a proceeding could or ought to have
been taken under this Act, shall be done in accordance with the provisions of this Act
and no Civil or Revenue Court shall entertain any suit or proceeding with respect to
rights in such land or with respect to any other matters for which a proceeding could
or ought to have been taken under this Act."
9. Supreme Court in Dina Nath v. State of U.P., (2010) 15 SCC 218, while upholding the direction of
this Court for holding inquiry in respect of the entries made during consolidation over government
land held that the Court cannot be a silent spectator and is bound to perform its constitutional duty
for ensuring that the public property is not frittered by unscrupulous elements in the power
corridors and acts of grabbing public land are properly inquired into and appropriate remedial
action taken.
10. In order to avoid bar of Section 49, it is appropriate that District Deputy Director of
Consolidation may conduct an inquiry and examine the correctness of the records including
prepared during consolidation in exercise of his jurisdiction under Section 48 of U.P. Consolidation
of Holdings Act, 1953.
11. In the absence of any notification under Section 117 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951, Gaon Sabha has
nothing to do in the matter, as held by Supreme Court in U.P. State Sugar Corporation Ltd. Vs. Dy.
Director of Consolidation, AIR 2000 SC 878. However, under Section 6 (a) of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951,
Mahesh Chandra Saxena And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru. Collector, Kheri And ... on 16 July, 2024

forest was vested in State of U.P. and respondent-3 is a department of State of U.P. assigned with
the responsibility of maintaining forest as such Forest Department of State of U.P. and State of U.P.
are necessary parties and required to be heard along with the petitioners by District Deputy Director
of Consolidation. Since, the village has undergone into consolidation operation as entry made by
consolidation authorities cannot be corrected exercising powers under U.P. Land Revenue Act, 1901.
12. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the writ petition is allowed. The orders of Up-Ziladhikari,
dated 28.10.1999 and Board of Revenue, U.P. dated 11.10.2000 are set aside. The matter is
remanded to District Deputy Director of Consolidation Kheri to conduct a proper inquiry after
giving opportunity of hearing to the parties, if necessary he may frame issue and remit the matter to
Consolidation Officer for recording oral and documentary evidence of the parties and pass
appropriate order. After receiving evidence and findings of Consolidation Officer he shall decide the
matter after hearing the parties. Since the matter is lingering for a long time and issue of public
property is allegedly involved, he shall decide the matter expeditiously."
39. A perusal of the above quoted portion of the judgment of this Court dated 12.09.2014 indicates
that this Court did not accept the claim of petitioners based upon Section 20(b) of the Act of 1950
and remanded the matter before the respondent No.2-District Magistrate/District Deputy Director
of Consolidation, Lakhimpur Kheri, with direction to conduct a proper inquiry after giving
opportunity of hearing to the parties, if necessary, he may frame issue and remit the matter back to
respondent No.3-Consolidation Officer, for recording oral and documentary evidence of the parties
and pass appropriate orders and thereafter decide the matter after hearing the parties.
40. After the order dated 12.09.2014, respondent No.2-District Magistrate/District Deputy Director
of Consolidation, Lakhimpur-Kheri, proceeded in the matter, as appears from Annexure no.17 of the
petition, which is a copy of the objection filed by the petitioners which was entertained by
respondent No.2 on 10.12.2014.
41. Thereafter, respondent No.2 vide order dated 09.09.2015 sent the matter to the respondent
No.3-Consolidation Officer, Antim Abhilekh Second, Lakhimpur-Kheri.
42. Before the respondent No.3 the evidence was adduced by the parties, which is evident from the
impugned order(s), Para 33 and Annexure No.18 of the Writ Petition. Annexure No. 18 is the copy of
affidavit of evidence of the witnesses of the Forest Department, namely Satya Prakash, Van Daroga,
who was duly cross examined.
43. It is to be noted that the petitioners have not placed before this Court the evidence adduced from
the side of petitioners, though under law, the petitioners are under obligation to place each and
every material on record before this Court.
44. Based upon the evidence adduced by the parties respondent No.3 passed the order dated
16.10.2019, impugned herein, whereby a direction was issued to expunge names of the petitioners
from the revenue records.

45. The order dated 16.10.2019 was challenged by the petitioners by means of an Appeal
No.583/2019541043000575 (Mahesh Chandra & Others vs. Prabhagiya Vanadhikari & Others),
which was disposed of on 19.07.2022. Thereafter, the petitioners approached this Court by means of
Writ - B No.570 of 2022 (Mahesh Chandra Saxena and 5 others vs. Distt. Dy. Director of
Consolidation/Collector, Lakhimpur Kheri And 5 Ors.), challenging the order(s) dated 09.09.2015
and 16.10.2019 passed by respondent No.2 and respondent No.3, respectively, as also consequential
order dated 26.08.2021 passed by the respondent No.3-Consolidation Officer, Antim Abhilekh
Second, Lakhimpur Kheri.
46. This Court, after considering the entire facts of the case, dismissed the petition vide final order
dated 26.09.2022. The relevant part of order of this Court dated 26.09.2022 reads as under:-
"In the light of the aforesaid directions the District Deputy Director of Consolidation
passed the order dated 9.9.2015 which is annexed as Annexure-1 and thereafter the
matter was considered by the Consolidation Officer by a detailed order dated
16.10.2019 which came to be assailed in appeal which was allowed on 26.8.2021. It is
also to be noticed that the order dated 9.9.2015 whereby the District Deputy Director
of Consolidation remanded the matter to the Consolidation Officer was never
challenged by the petitioners at that point of time. Moreover, the petitioners
participated in the proceedings and never raised any objections regarding
jurisdiction. It is also to be noticed that being aggrieved against the order dated
16.10.2019 the petitioners preferred an appeal which came to be allowed and it is only
thereafter when the Consolidation Officer by means of his report dated 7.9.2022 by
which the entire matter has now again been remitted to the District Deputy Director
of Consolidation and now the petitioners have approached this court assailing the
entire orders and the exercise which has taken place. The court further finds that the
matter is open to be considered before the District Deputy Director of Consolidation,
Lakhimpur Kheri, where the date is fixed for 7.10.2022. Till date the petitioners have
not raised any objection before any of the Consolidation Authority except by filing the
instant writ petition. Once the initial remand order dated 9.9.2015 was not
challenged and after having participated in the proceedings and at this later stage the
petitioners have preferred this writ petition in the aforesaid background, this court is
not inclined to entertain this petition, especially when the entire matter is open to be
considered by the District Deputy Director of Consolidation, Lakhimpur Kheri, where
the matter is listed on 7.10.2022.
It shall be open for the petitioner to raise all his grievances and objections before the
said court and in case such objections are raised, needless to say that the authority
shall consider and decide the same in accordance with law, however, this court does
not deem appropriate to interfere at this stage. Accordingly the petition is dismissed."
47. After the aforesaid order of Writ Court dated 26.09.2022, respondent No.2 passed the impugned
order dated 10.04.2023, after providing proper opportunity of hearing to the parties to the
proceedings. The relevant portion of the impugned order dated 10.04.2023 reads as under:-

question for consideration, however, is whether the Consolidation Authorities have the jurisdiction
to go behind the notification under Section 20 of the Act and deal with the land which has been
declared and notified as a reserve forest under the Act. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the
scheme of Chapter II of the Act. Section 3 provides that the State Government may constitute any
forest land or waste land which is the property of the Government or over which the Government
has proprietary rights, or to the whole or any part of the forest produce to which the Government is
entitled, a reserved forest. Section 4 provides for the issue of a notification declaring the intention of
the Government to constitute a reserved forest. Section 5 bars accrual of forest rights in the are

covered by the notification under section 4 after the issue of the notification. Section 6, inter alia,
gives power to the Forest Settlement Officer to issue a proclamation fixing a period of not less than
three months from the date of such proclamation and requiring every person claiming any right
mentioned in Section 4 or Section 5 within such period, either to present to the Forest Settlement
Officer a written notice specifying or to appear before him, and state the nature of such right and the
amount and particulars of the compensation (if any) claimed in respect thereof. Section 7 gives
power to the Forest Settlement Officer to investigate the objections. Section 8 prescribes that the
Forest Settlement Officer shall have the same powers as a Civil Court has in the trial of a suit.
Section, inter alia, provides for the extinction of rights where no claim is made under Section 6.
Section 11(1) lays down that in the case of a claim to a right in or over any land, other than a right of
way or right of pasture, or a right to forest produce or water course, the Forest Settlement Officer
shall pass an order admitting or rejecting the same in whole or in part. In the event of admitting the
right of any person to the land, the Forest Settlement Officer, under Section 11(2), can either exclude
such land from the limits of the proposed forest or come to an agreement with the ower thereof for
the surrender of his rights or proceed to acquire such land in the manner provided by the Land
Acquisition Act, 1884. Section 17 provides for appeal from various orders under the Act and Section
18(4) for revision before the State Government. When all the proceedings provided under Section 3
to 19 are over the State Government has to publish a notification under Section 20 specifying
definitely the limits of the Forest which is to be reserved and declaring the same to be reserved from
the date fixed by the notification.
It is thus obvious that the forest settlement officer has the powers of a civil court and his order is
subject to appeal and finally revision before the state government. The act is a complete code in
itself and contains elaborate procedure for declaring and notifying a reserve forest. Once a
notification under section 20 of the act declaring a land as reserve forest in published, then all the
rights in the said land claimed by any person come to an end are no longer available. The
notification is binding on the Consolidation Authorities in the same way as a decree of the civil
court. The respondents could very well file objections and claims including objection regarding the
nature of the land before the Forest Officer. They did not file any objection or claim before the
authorities in the proceedings under the Act. After the notification under Section 20 of the Act, the
respondents could not have raised any objections qua the said notification before the Consolidation
Authorities. The Consolidation Authorities were bound by the notification which has achieved
finality."

49. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Bachan and Ors. vs. Kankar and Ors. (1972) 2 SCC 555;
observed as under:-
"15. This Court in Sonawati v. Sri Ram [AIR 1968 SC 466(1968) 1 SCR 617 :] said that
Section 20 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1951 conferred
certain rights upon persons whose names were recorded in the revenue records in
respect of agricultural land. In Sonawati case this Court found that there was strong
evidence which was relied on by the Revenue Court that the name of Pritam Singh
predecessor-in-interest of the appellants was surreptitiously entered in the Khasra.
The first appellate court there did not at all consider that evidence. The surreptitious
entry in Sonawati case was held by this Court to disentitle the appellants to any
adhivasi right under Section 20 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms
Act.

16. This Court recently in Ram Das v. Deputy Director of Consolidation, Ballia,
[(1971) 1 SCC 460 : AIR 1971 SC 673] dealt with the contention of the appellants on
the one hand who were recorded as Sir Khudkasht-holders of the plots in dispute and
the contention of the respondents on the other who were entered as sub-tenants in
respect of those plots in the year 1356 Fasli. Suits were filed between the parties. A
compromise was entered into the suits. It was admitted by the respondents that the
appellants were Bhoomidars and that the respondents had no interest. The further
admission in the compromise was that the entry in the revenue records in favour of
the respondents was fictitious. The respondents subsequently applied for setting
aside the compromise decrees on the ground that they had been obtained
fraudulently. During the pendency of the suits consolidation proceedings under the
U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 commenced. The Consolidation Authorities
held that the suits were not maintainable because on the date on which the suits were
filed the respondents had become sirdars. The appellants filed a writ petition under
Article 226 challenging the order of the Consolidation Authorities. The High Court
held in that case relying on the earlier decisions of that Court that even if the entry
was fictitious the respondents who were recorded as occupants would, under Section
20(b) of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1951 become adhivasi
of the disputed land. This Court relying on the earlier decision in Sonawati case held
that there was evidence to show that the entry was fictitious and the person whose
name was entered on the record on the material date could not claim the right of an
adhivasi.
17. The rulings of this Court establish that the decision of the learned Single Judge as
well as that of the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court is erroneous. Section
20 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 speaks of a person
recorded as occupant to become adhivasi of the land and will be entitled to take or
retain possession as mentioned in the section. One of the principal matters
mentioned in the section is that the Khasra or Khatauni of 1356 Fasli is to be
prepared under Sections 28 and 33 of the U.P. Land Revenue Act, 1901. The U.P.
Land Records Manual in Chapter A-V in para A-55 to A-67 lays down the manner in
which the Khasra or the field book showing possession is to be prepared by the
Patwari in the areas to which Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950
applies. There are detailed instructions about the manner in which the enquiry
should be carried out about actual possession and change in possession and
corrections in the map and field book, the form in which the khasra is to be prepared.
The form of khasra is given in para A-80. The form shows that the Lekhpal has to
prepare a consolidated list of entries after partial or proper investigation. Again, para
A-70 to A-73 to the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act show how
entries have to be made in khataunis every year showing the nature of tenure of each
holder. The khatauni is meant to be a record of tenure-holders. The manner of
changes to be made there is laid down in para A-82 to A-83. Entries are to be
checked. Extract has to be sent to the Chairman, Land Management Committee as
contemplated in paragraph A-82 (iii). In this context Section 20(b)(i) of the U.P.

Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act which speaks of the record "as occupant"
in the khasra or khatauni of 1355 Fasli refers to the khasra or khatauni being
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Land Revenue Act, 1961. Khasra is
the field book provided for by Section 28 of the Land Revenue Act. Khatauni is an
annual register prepared under Section 32 of the Land Revenue Act 1951. It has to be
emphasised that the entry under Section 20 (b)(i) of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition
and Land Reforms Act, 1950 in order to enable a person to obtain adhivasi rights
must be an entry under the provisions of law.
18. This Court has held that entries which are not genuine cannot confirm adhivasi
rights. The High Court wrongly held that though the entry was incorrect it could not
be said to be fictitious. It is too obvious to be stressed that an entry which is
incorrectly introduced into the records by reason of ill-will or hostility is not only
shorn of authenticity but also becomes utterly useless without any lawful basis.
19. The learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court held that the Deputy
Director of Consolidation did not have the jurisdiction while dismissing the revision
application in the consolidation proceedings to hold that the entry was fictitious. The
Deputy Director of Consolidation pointed out that the entry was held to be fictitious
by a civil court also. The Settlement Officer was the final Court of fact. The order of
the Settlement Officer found that the entries relied on by the respondents were mala
fide, contrary to rules and false. The view of the learned Single Judge confirmed by
the Division Bench is antithetic to the basic principles that fraudulent or mala fide
actions have no legal sanction.
20. The High Court erred in quashing the order of the Deputy Director of
Consolidation and the order of the Settlement Officer. The High Court overlooked the
evidence. The High Court relied on surreptitious entry as lawful entry. A fabricated
entry is obviously a fictitious entry. In the present case, the entry was introduced by
the Patwari by devious methods. Such entry is mendacious."
50. In the case of Mohd. Ramzan Khan vs. D.D.C., Allahabad and Others; 2009 SCC OnLine All 1111,
this Court observed as under:-
"Entry of occupant in 1356 Fasli confers a right upon that person under Section 20(b)
of the Act. Original petitioner and respondent No. 35 were not recorded in 1356 Fasli.
Even in respect of that provision, the Supreme Court has held that an entry in 1356
Fasli may confer right upon the recorded person even if the entry is wrong, however if
the entry is fraudulent or made without any basis it will not confer any right
vide Wali Mohd. v. Ram Surat, AIR 1989 SC 2296 and "Chandrika
Prasad v. Pullo" AIR 2000 SC 1785. Paras No. 4 & 5 of the earlier authority, which
were quoted in Para-21 of the later authority also, are quoted below:

"4. The said section deals with the question as to who is entitled to take or retain
possession of the land in question. The plain language of the aforesaid Cl. (i) of
sub-sec. (b) of S. 20 of the said Act suggests that this question has to be determined
on the basis of the entry in the Khasra or Khatauni of 1356 Fasli Year prepared under
Ss. 28 and 33 respectively of the U.P. Land Revenue Act, 1901. An analysis of the said
section shows that under sub-sec. (b) of S. 20 the entry in the Khasra or Khatauni of
the Fasli Year 1356 shall determine the question as to the person who is entitled to
take or retain possession of the land. It is, of course, true that if the entry is fictitious
or is found to have been made surreptitiously then it can have no legal effect as it can
be regarded as no entry in law but merely because an entry is made incorrectly that
would not lead to the conclusion that it ceases to be an entry. It is possible that the
said entry may be set aside in appropriate proceedings but once the entry is in
existence in the Khasra or Khatauni of Fasli Year 1356, that would govern the
question as to who is entitled to take or retain possession of the land to which the
entry relates.
5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that if the entry was not
correct it could not be regarded as an entry made according to law at all and the right
to take or retain possession of the land could not be determined on the basis of an
i n c o r r e c t  e n t r y .  H e  p l a c e d  r e l i a n c e  o n  t h e  d e c i s i o n  o f  t h i s  C o u r t
in Bechan v. Kankar, (1973) 1 SCR 727 : (AIR 1972 SC 2157). In that judgment the
nature of the entries in Khasra or Khatauni is discussed and it is also discussed as to
how this entry should be made. This Court held that entries which are not genuine
cannot confer Adhivasi rights. It has been observed that an entry under S. 20(b) of
the said Act, in order to enable a person to obtain Adhivasi rights must be an entry
under the provisions of law and entries which are not genuine cannot confer Adhivasi
rights. In that judgment it has been stated that the High Court was wrong when it
held that though the entry was incorrect, it could not be said to be fictitious. That
observation, however, has to be understood in the context of what follows namely,
that an entry which is incorrectly introduced into the records by reason of ill-will or
hostility is not only shorn of authenticity but also becomes utterly useless without
Any lawful basis. This judgment, in our view, does not lay down that all incorrect
entries are fictitious but only lays down that a wrong entry or incorrect entry which
has been made by reason of ill-will or hostility cannot confer any right under S. 20(b)
of the said Act. This decision is clarified by a subsequent judgment of this Court
in Vishwa Vijai Bharti v. Fakhrul Hasan, (1976) Suppl SCR 519 : (AIR 1976 SC 1485)
where it has been held as follows (at p. 1488 of AIR):
"It is true that the entries in the revenue record ought generally, to be accepted at
their face value and courts should not embark upon an appellate inquiry into their
correctness. But the presumption of correctness can apply only to genuine not forged
or fraudulent, entries. The distinction may be fine but it is real. The distinction is that
one cannot challenge the correctness of what the entry in the revenue record states
but the entry is open to the attack that it was made fraudulently or surreptitiously.

Fraud and forgery rob a document of all its legal effect and cannot found a claim to
possessory title."
Accordingly, I do not find least error in the impugned orders. Original petitioner and respondent
No. 35 could not justify the entries of their names in the revenue records of 1358 & 1359 Fasli."
51. In the case of Gujj Lal and Ors. vs. Dy. Director of Consolidation, Firozabad and Ors., 2015 SCC
OnLine All 8063, this Court in relation to the entry in the revenue record observed as under:-
"8. I have considered the arguments of the Counsel for the parties and examined the
record. Section 57 of U.??? Land Revenue Act, 1901, attaches presumption of
correctness of settlement year khatauni. Khatauni of 1356-F and 1359-F are
settlement year khatauni. The respondent filed khatauni 1348-F and 1349-F and
proved that joint family property has been partitioned between Vovid and
descendants of Shyama, who were brothers by decree of Sub-Divisional Officer dated
6.12.1941, passed in partition Suit No. 42/5, which was incorporated in khata 47 of
1348-F. According to partition decree, 2.73 acre land came in share of Indrapal, 2.73
acre land came in share of Ninnu, Sarnam and Mihilal jointly and 5.45 acre land
came in share of Vovid. It has also been noted in khatauni 1348-F that Charani and
Shripat being daughter's sons of Vovid were his heirs. According to the partition
decree, khatauni 1349-F was prepared, in which, the names of Charani and Shripat
sons of Rate were recorded in khata 21, consisting eight plots of an area of 5.45,
which had come in the share of Vovid in partition suit. Same plots with same area
were recorded in khata 11 of 1356-F khatauni, in which along with Charani and
Shripat, names of Ninnu, Sarnam and Mihilal sons of Summer were also recorded
and this entry continued later on. Thus the respondent has proved that land which
was came in exclusive share of Vovid was inherited by him but names of Ninnu,
Sarnam and Mihilal were wrongly recorded over it along with their names in 1356-F
khatauni without any basis. Thus presumption of correctness stood rebutted from the
evidence of the respondent. Now burden of proof shifted upon the petitioners to
prove that their names were correctly recorded.
9. The petitioners took plea that Charani and Shripat were unable to pay rent of the
land in dispute to zamindars as such they co-opted Ninnu, Sarnam and Mihilal as
co-sharers of ½ share in the land in dispute with the consent of zamindar. Section 33
of U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939, which was applicable at the relevant time provides as
follows--
Section 33. Interest of other tenants.--(1) The interest of a tenant holding on special
terms in Oudh, of an ex-proprietary tenant, of an occupancy tenant, of a hereditary
tenant, and of a non-occupancy tenant is heritable, but is not transferable otherwise
than in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
(2) Notwithstanding in forgoing provisions of this section shall render illegal--
Mahesh Chandra Saxena And Others vs State Of U.P. Thru. Collector, Kheri And ... on 16 July, 2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76142227/
59

(a) a sub-lease of a holding as hereinafter provided.
(b) a sale of the interest of a tenant under the provisions of section 251.
(c) a release or transfer of an interest in favour of a co-tenants:
Provided that no person shall be deemed to be a co-tenant notwithstanding that he
may have shared in the cultivation of the holding, unless he was a co-tenant from the
commencement of the tenancy, or has become such by succession or has been
specifically recognized as such in writing by the land holder.
10.Thus under law, a written consent of zamindar was necessary for co-option. No
such written consent of zamindar was produced by the petitioners. Theory of the
petitioners that they had been through out paying rent of their half shares has also
not been proved by them as the petitioners have filed 4 rent receipts, out of which
one of the year 1358-F, one of the year 1359-F and two were of the year 1397-F. Apart
from it, there are noting in khatauni 1356-F and 1359-F that original khataunis were
in torn condition, which itself create a doubt regarding its correctness. Thus the
findings that the petitioners could not prove that they were co-opted as co-tenant or
paying rents of half share or were in possession of the land in dispute, do not suffer
from any illegality. An illegal and unauthorized entry in khatauni cannot become a
legal entry only on the ground that it has been perpetuated for a long time due to
negligence of revenue authority or right owner as such on its basis no right can accrue
to any one.
11. Supreme Court in Vishwa Vijay Bharati v. Fakhrul Hassan, [1976 RD 237 (SC).]
held that it is true that the entries in the revenue record ought, generally, to be
accepted at their face value and Courts should not embark upon an appellate inquiry
into their correctness. But the presumption of correctness can apply only to genuine,
not forged or fraudulent, entries. The distinction may be fine but it is real. The
distinction is that one cannot challenge the correctness of what the entry in the
revenue record states but the entry is open to the attack that it was made fraudulently
or surreptitiously. Fraud and forgery rob a document of all its legal effect and cannot
found a claim to possessory title. This judgment has been followed in Wali
Mohhd. v. Ram Surat, [1989 RD 403 (SC).] Again in Vikram Singh Junior High
School v. District Magistrate (Fin. & Rev.), [2002 (93) RD 278 (SC).] it has been held
that the entry in the revenue record must have a legal basis. Further there was no
adjudication of dispute as regards continuance of the wrong entry. The appellant
could not have claimed any title over the land in dispute merely on the basis of wrong
entry which continued in its favour through negligence or failure of the Revenue
Officer or the Consolidation Officer to correct the record, in pursuance of the order of
the Board of Revenue which had attained finality. In the consolidation proceedings,
the Collector is also the District Deputy Director of Consolidation under the U.P.
Consolidation of Holdings Act and is authorized to correct any wrong entry continued

in the consolidation record in that capacity in the exercise of power under section 48.
of the U.P. Con-solidation of Holdings Act.
12. A Special Bench of 5 Hon'ble, Judges in Basdeo v. Board of Revenue, U.P., [1974
RD 188 (DB).] and Supreme Court in Bechan v. Kankar, [1972 RD 219 (SC).]
and Ram Harakh v. Hamid Ahmad Khan, [(1998) 7 SCC 484.] held that in order to
get right under section 20 of U.P. Act No. 1 of 1951 on basis of entry of "recorded
occupant" in 1356-F and 1359 F, entry must have been made according to the
provisions of Land Records Manual and genuine. In the present case, it has been
found that the entry of the names of the petitioners was not a genuine entry as such
under law no right accrued to them on the basis of unauthorized entry.
13. There is difference between "fraud" and "fabricated entry". Supreme Court
in Reliance Salt Ltd. v. Cosmos Enterprises, [2007 (66) ALR 653 (SC) : 2007 (50) AIC
82.] held that "Fraud" means and includes any of the following acts committed by a
party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent, with intent to deceive
another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract--
"(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it
to be true;
(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact;
(3) a promise made without any intention of performing it;
(4) any other act fitted to deceive;
(5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent.
Explanation.--Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a
contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that, regard being had to them, it
is the duty of the person keeping silence to speak, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to
speech."
14. Supreme Court in Bachan v. Kankar, [1972 RD 219 (SC).] held that fabricated entry is an entry
which is incorrectly introduced into the records by reason of ill-will or hostility is not only shorn of
authenticity but also becomes utterly useless without any lawful basis.
15. Thus case law relied upon by the petitioners, on the proposition of "fraud" has no application in
this case. Only this much was required to be examined that entry in favour of the petitioners was
genuine or fabricated and unauthorized. It has been found that entry of the names of the petitioners
in khata in dispute was unauthorized. There is no illegality in the order of Deputy Director of
Consolidation. In view of aforesaid discussions, the writ petition has merit and is dismissed.

16.Petition Dismissed."
52. On the question/issue, indicated in Para 23 of this judgment, this Court considered the (i) facts
of the case, (ii) documents on record particularly questionnaire (Annexure No.3) and Khatauni of
1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) (Annexure No.4), relied upon by the petitioners, and also Khatauni of 1356
Fasli (1949 A.D.), indicated in Para 28 of this judgment and which is also part of written submission
dated 01.04.2024 filed by the petitioners, (iii) provisions indicated above and (iv) pronouncements
on the issue of extending the benefit of Section 20(b) of the Act of 1950 including the judgments
passed in the case of Smt. Sonawati (Supra) and Ram Avadh (Supra), relied upon by learned counsel
for the petitioners.
53. Upon due consideration, this Court is of the view that the petitioners are not entitled to benefit
of Section 20(b) of the Act of 1950. It is for the following facts and reasons:-
(a) Entries indicated in the documents (Questionnaire and Khatauni of 1359 Fasli),
relied upon by the petitioners, are not genuine. The same, to the view of this Court,
are bogus, forged, fictitious and fabricated and have been made surreptitiously. It is
in view of the following reasons:-
(i) In the 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.), the land in dispute was recorded as "Imarati Lakdi
Ka Jungle" (Timber Trees), as indicated in entry (8) (iii)(a)(1) in Para 124-A of U.P.
Land Records Manual and in this year the total area was 431.61 acres and in the
Khatauni of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) the land in dispute was not recorded in the name
of Raja Brijraj Bahadur Singh, (the basis of claim of predecessor-in-interest of
petitioner and the petitioners).
(ii) From the certified photocopy of the Khatauni of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.), (annexed
as Annexure No. 4 to the writ petition), it is evident that area of Gata/Plot No. 21 i.e.
431.46 acres mentioned in Khatauni of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) was reduced by making
correction/cutting to 393.91 acres and this correction/cutting was made without any
order of the competent Revenue Official and it bears signature of someone, whose
designation has not been disclosed.
(iii) After reducing the original area i.e. 431.46 acres to 393.91 acres different
Gata(s)/Plot(s) were carved out as Gata No(s). 21, 21/2, 21/3, 21/4, 21/5, 21/6 & 21/7
in the names of Daal Singh S/o Mom Raj Singh, Gopal Singh S/o Sagar, Buddha S/o
Kamma, Surta S/o Buddha, Param Singh S/o Mom Raj Singh and Amru S/o Ram
Ram, (the basis of claim of predecessor-in-interest of petitioner and the petitioners),
respectively, showing Barley (Jow) crop against Gata No(s). 21/1 to 21/7, respectively,
under Ziman 5-A entry, which finds place in Para A-124 of U.P. Land Records
Manual, and the same says that "Occupiers of lands without title when there is no one
already recorded in column 5 of the khasra" and this was also carried out without any
order in this regard.

(iv) Entry i.e. 8(iii)(a)(1) in Para 124-A of U.P. Land Records Manual and the note
appended to the same itself indicate that the same was under the control of Forest
Department meaning thereby under the control of State Government.
(v) The alleged entry of 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) in favour of Raja Brijraj Bahadur
Singh, as indicated in questionnaire, is forged one and the fact that questionnaire
itself is forged/fabricated and bogus document is evident from the fact that in the
year 1999 the age of trees was found to be between 80-100 year and accordingly in
the 1356 Fasli (1949 A.D.) or 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) the age of the trees must be
between 40-60 year and to impeach/controvert the same and also the findings
related to existence of trees over the land in issue, which in fact was admitted by
Mahesh Chandra Saxena and Nanhey Lal Sharma (Petitioner No. 4) during their
examination and the same is evident from the impugned order dated 10.04.2023,
nothing has been placed on record.
(vi) The benefit of Section 20(b) of the Act of 1950 would be available if the entry
was/is genuine and in this case, the entry of 1359 Fasli (1952 A.D.) itself was/is bogus
and fraudulent and as such, no right would be available to the petitioners based upon
the sale deed as their basis itself is not a valid document in the eye of law. Reference
in this regard can be made to the maxim(s) 'Sublato Fundamento Cadit Opus', which
means 'foundation being removed, the structure falls', 'Nemo dat quod non habet'
which means 'no one can give what they do not have'.
54. For the reasons aforesaid, this Court is not inclined to interfere in the impugned order(s)
10.04.2023 and 16.10.2019 passed by respondent No.2-District Magistrate/District Deputy Director
of Consolidation, Lakhimpur Kheri and respondent No.3-Consolidation Officer, Antim Abhilekh
Second, Lakhimpur Kheri, respectively, on the grounds pressed by the learned counsel for the
petitioners including the ground that respondent No.2 has failed to act in terms of order of remand
of this Court dated 12.09.2014 as if the order(s) are interfered on this ground, then in that event the
bogus/forged entries favourable to the petitioners would revive in the revenue records.
55. Having observed above, this Court finds no force in the present petition. It is accordingly
dismissed. Costs made easy.
56. The Court records the valuable assistance given by Ms. Urmish Shankar, Research Associate,
attached with me in drafting this judgment and finding out case laws applicable in the present case.
