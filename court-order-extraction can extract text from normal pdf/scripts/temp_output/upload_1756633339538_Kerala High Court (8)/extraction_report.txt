"On 2 February 2024, Bail Application No. 41 of 2024 was filed by Ibrahim, aged 36, accused in Crime No. 922/2023 of Vengara Police Station. He is charged under Section 286 IPC and Sections 4(b) & 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, for allegedly conducting illegal quarrying and blasting granite without a license, endangering life and property. The court denied anticipatory bail due to the need for proper investigation. However, directions were issued for Ibrahim to surrender within two weeks, after which his bail request could be considered on merits. If he does not surrender, the Investigating Officer is free to arrest him."
