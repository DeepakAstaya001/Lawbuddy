Here is the summary:

On 2 February 2024, Bail Application No. 41 of 2024 was filed by Ibrahim, aged 36, accused in Crime No. 922/2023 of Vengara Police Station. He faces charges under Section 286 IPC and Sections 4(b) & 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, for alleged illegal quarrying and blasting granite without a license. The court denied anticipatory bail due to concerns over proper investigation. However, directions were issued for Ibrahim to surrender within two weeks, after which his bail request could be considered on merits. If he fails to surrender, the investigating officer can arrest him as if no order had been passed in this case.
