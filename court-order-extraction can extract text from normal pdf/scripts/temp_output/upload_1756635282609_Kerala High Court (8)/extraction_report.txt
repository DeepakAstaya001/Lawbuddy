Here is the summary of the court order:

"On 2 February 2024, Bail Application No. 41 of 2024 filed by Ibrahim, aged 36 accused in Crime No. 922/2023 of Vengara Police Station. He was charged with Section 286 IPC and Sections 4(b) & 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 for allegedly conducting illegal quarrying and blasting granite without a license. Anticipatory bail was denied due to his ownership of the site and a pending similar offence. However, directions were issued for him to surrender within two weeks after which his bail request could be considered on merits. If he surrenders, he would be interrogated and produced before the Magistrate."
