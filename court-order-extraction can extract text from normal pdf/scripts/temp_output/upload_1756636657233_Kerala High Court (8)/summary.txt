Here is a summary of the court order:

"On 2 February 2024, Bail Application No. 41 of 2024 filed by Ibrahim, aged 36 accused in Crime No. 922/2023 of Vengara Police Station. He is charged under Section 286 IPC and Sections 4(b) & 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 for allegedly conducting illegal quarrying and blasting granite without a license, endangering life and property. The court denied anticipatory bail due to concerns about proper investigation and his involvement in another similar offence. However, Ibrahim is directed to surrender within two weeks, after which he can apply for bail on merits. If he fails to surrender, the Investigating Officer can arrest him as if no order had been passed."
