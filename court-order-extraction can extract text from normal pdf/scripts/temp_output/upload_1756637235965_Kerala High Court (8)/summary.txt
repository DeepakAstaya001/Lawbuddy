"On 2 February 2024, Bail Application No. 41 of 2024 filed by Ibrahim, aged 36 accused in Crime No. 922/2023 of Vengara Police Station. He is charged under Section 286 IPC and Sections 4(b) & 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 for allegedly conducting illegal quarrying and blasting granite without a license, endangering life and property. The court denied anticipatory bail due to ownership of the site and pending similar offences. However, directions were issued for Ibrahim to surrender within two weeks, after which his bail request could be considered on merits. If he surrenders, he will be interrogated and produced before a Magistrate."
