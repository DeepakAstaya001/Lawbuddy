This application is filed under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, seeking pre-arrest bail.
2. 
The petitioner is the second accused in Crime No.922/2023
of Vengara Police Station, Malappuram District, for having allegedly
committed offences punishable under Section 286 of the Indian Penal
Code and Section 4(b) and Section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act,
1908.
3. 
The prosecution case is that on 16.11.2023 at about 4.30
p.m.,  at  Naduvakkad-Cheruppadimala  in  Oorakam  Village,  the  first
accused, along with his son and other relatives were found quarrying
without any license, and the accused transported the granite after blasting
the same, which resulted in endangering human life and property by using
explosive substances and thereby committed the offence.
4. 
The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and the
learned Public Prosecutor were heard.     
2024/KER/7605

B.A.No. 41/2024
 ..3..
5. 
Considering the allegations against the petitioner and the fact
that the petitioner is stated to be the owner of the property where the
illegal quarrying was carried on and the inclusion of provisions of the
Explosive Substances Act, I do not think this is a fit case to grant
anticipatory bail as it might affect a proper investigation, more so when
one more similar crime is reported against the petitioner. Therefore, the
following directions are issued:- 
6.
In the event the petitioner surrenders before the Investigating
Officer in two weeks, he shall be interrogated and thereafter, shall be
produced  before  the  Magistrate  having  jurisdiction  on  the  date  of
surrender itself. If the petitioner moves for bail, the court below shall,
untrammelled by any of the observations in this order, consider the bail
application on merits as expeditiously as possible. If the petitioner does
not surrender before the Investigating Officer, as directed above, the
Investigating Officer will be free to arrest the petitioner as if no order has
been passed in this case. 
7.
The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that as per
Annexure A3 order, the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail in Crime
No.969/2023 of Vengara Police Station, alleging similar offences. This
Court, by order dated 05/01/2024, in exercise of the supervisory power
2024/KER/7605

B.A.No. 41/2024
 ..4..
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, enlarged the time fixed in
the said order for the petitioner to appear before the investigating officer
till 12/01/2024 and the same was extended till 30/01/2024. Accordingly,
the petitioner is granted ten days time from today to comply with the
conditions in Annexure A3 order. 
The bail application is disposed of as above.
