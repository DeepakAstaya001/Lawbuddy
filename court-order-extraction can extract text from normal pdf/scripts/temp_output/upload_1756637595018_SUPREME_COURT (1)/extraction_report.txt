📄 Case Summary:
------------------------------
Here is a summary of the judgment in Nagaraj (supra) in the requested format:

"On September 26, 2018, The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India decided to maintain its previous ruling. The court held that the State does not need to collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for reservation purposes under Article 16(4-A). This decision is based on the reasoning that the concept of 'backward classes' in Article 16(4) is equivalent to 'weaker sections of the people' in Article 46. The court also emphasized that the proportionality test to the population is not applicable for determining adequacy of representation in promotional posts."
