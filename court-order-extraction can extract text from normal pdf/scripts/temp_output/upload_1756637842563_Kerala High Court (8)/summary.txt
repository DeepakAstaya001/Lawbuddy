On 2 February 2024, Bail Application No. 41 of 2024 was filed by Ibrahim, aged 36, accused in Crime No. 922/2023 of Vengara Police Station. He is charged under Section 286 IPC and Sections 4(b) & 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, for allegedly conducting illegal quarrying and blasting granite without a license, endangering life and property. The court noted his ownership of the site and a pending similar offence. Anticipatory bail was denied due to concerns about affecting proper investigation. However, directions were issued for Ibrahim to surrender within two weeks for interrogation before being produced before a Magistrate.
