**Case Summary**

On September 26, 2018, the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in W.P.(C) No. 692/2017, addressing the issue of reservation for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in promotions under Article 16(4-A). The court reaffirmed that quantifiable data is not necessary to determine backwardness or adequacy of representation. It clarified that adequate representation in promotional posts depends on the States' assessment, considering efficiency and administrative requirements. The judgment upheld the principles established in Nagaraj (2006) and Indra Sawhney (1992), striking down certain provisions of Article 16(4-A) as contrary to the Constitution.
