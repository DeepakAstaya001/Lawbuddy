Here is the example summary in the specified format:

"On September 26, 2018, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court delivered its verdict in Indra Sawhney (2) case. The court upheld the majority opinion in Nagaraj (2006), which laid down conditions for reservation in promotions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. However, it held that collecting quantifiable data showing backwardness was not necessary. The court also clarified that the proportion of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the population should be taken into account to determine adequacy of representation. The decision emphasized efficiency of administration and administrative discretion in promoting Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe employees."
