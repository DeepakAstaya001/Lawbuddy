However, it held that collecting quantifiable data showing backwardness was not necessary. The court also clarified that the proportion of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the population should be taken into account to determine adequacy of representation. The decision emphasized efficiency of administration and administrative discretion in promoting Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe employees."
