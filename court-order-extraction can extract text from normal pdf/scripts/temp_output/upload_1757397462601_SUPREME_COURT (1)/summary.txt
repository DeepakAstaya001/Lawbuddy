**Judgment of September 26, 2018**

The Supreme Court dismissed the need for a seven-judge bench to review the judgment in Nagaraj (supra). The court also held that the requirement for quantifiable data showing backwardness of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is contrary to the nine-judge bench in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) and thus invalid. The court noted that Article 16(4-A) allows states to determine adequate representation depending on the promotional post, and declined to adopt a proportionality test based on population as mandated by Article 330.
