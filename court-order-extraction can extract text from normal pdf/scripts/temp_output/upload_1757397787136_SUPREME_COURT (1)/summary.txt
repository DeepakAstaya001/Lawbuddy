**Case No.**: 
**Supreme Court of India**
**Date:** September 26, 2018
**Judges:** CJI Dipak Misra, Kurian Joseph, R.F. Nariman, Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Indu Malhotra

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court ruled that the judgment in Nagaraj (2006) does not require a review by a seven-judge bench. However, the court held that the requirement for quantifiable data on backwardness to be collected by the State, as per Nagaraj, is invalid and contrary to the nine-judge bench's decision in Indra Sawhney (1992). The court clarified that the proportion of Scheduled Castes and Tribes to the population should not be a fixed standard for determining adequacy of representation in promotional posts.
