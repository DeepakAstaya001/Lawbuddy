------------------------------
**Judgment in Nagaraj (supra)**

On September 26, 2018, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Nagaraj (supra). The court considered the issue of reservations in promotions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It held that the collection of quantifiable data on backwardness by the State is not required, contrary to the nine-Judge Bench decision in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra). However, the court declined to adopt a proportionality test to the population as a whole for determining adequacy of representation in promotional posts. The judgment clarifies the scope and intent of Article 16(4-A), upholding the constitutional amendments.
