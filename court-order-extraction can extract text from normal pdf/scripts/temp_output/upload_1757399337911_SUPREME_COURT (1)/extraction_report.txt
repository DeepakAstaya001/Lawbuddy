Here is a summary of the judgment in the given text:

"On September 26, 2018, a constitutional bench consisting of CJ Dipak Misra and Justices Kurian Joseph, R.F. Nariman, Sanjay Kishan Kaul, and Indu Malhotra delivered a judgment regarding reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under Article 16(4-A) of the Constitution. The court upheld the majority decision in Nagaraj vs. Union of India (2006), affirming that quantifiable data is not required to prove backwardness. However, it held that the conclusion in Nagaraj that the State must collect such data was invalid, as it contradicted the nine-Judge Bench judgment in Indra Sawhney vs. Union of India (1992). The court clarified that proportionality to population cannot be the sole criterion for determining adequate representation."
